In this supplementary results section the authors use GSEA on the EMD scores of each dense cluster to compare non-imputed data with imputed results from MAGIC and sc-PHENIX on the MCF7 MCTS dataset. Non-imputed data yield 21 HALLMARK pathways, MAGIC yields 41, and sc-PHENIX yields 45, with imputation uncovering more than 20 new HALLMARK pathways overall. Four HALLMARKs appear only with imputation: XENOBIOTIC_METABOLISM (clusters 6 and 10), WNT_BETA_CATENIN_SIGNALING (cluster 5), APICAL_JUNCITON (clusters 3 and 6), and COAGULATION (clusters 1 and 3). Based on these HALLMARKs, the authors delineate invasive, proliferative, transition, and necrotic phenotypes: invasive and proliferative markers are linked to specific cluster patterns under MAGIC (proliferative in clusters 0–3; invasive in cluster 4), with over-smoothing masking transitions and microenvironmental context such as hypoxia and nutrient deprivation. In contrast, sc-PHENIX reveals a broader repertoire of extreme phenotypes; in particular, necrotic-like states emerge in clusters 0–3 where MT genes and VEGFA are over-smoothed, with cluster 3 least represented for necrosis and a transition observed from cluster 10 toward cluster 4 accompanied by several inflammatory Hallmark pathways. APOPTOSIS Hallmark pathways appear in clusters 3 and 5. The authors also note that visualization of phenotype markers on UMAP and the CCR7–IL7R interaction in PBMC data corroborate these observations. They further present Section S10, an interactive dashboard of HDBSCAN clusters across t-SNE, UMAP, PHATE, and 3D PCA embeddings, with imputed expression of VEGFA, ANLN, HIF1A, and NACA illustrating extreme phenotypes in sc-PHENIX-imputed data and discussing the biological significance of these genes in the extreme states. The supplement also outlines other applications (Section S11) and an extensive set of supporting materials, including MNIST analyses, and a detailed catalog of supplementary tables and sections (S1–S8), all accessible via the provided MDPI link; the authors reiterate that there are no conflicts of interest.
