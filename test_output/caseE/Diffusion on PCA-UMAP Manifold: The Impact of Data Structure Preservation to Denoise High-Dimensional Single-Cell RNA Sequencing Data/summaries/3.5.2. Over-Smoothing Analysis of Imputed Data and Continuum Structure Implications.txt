Building on the observation that MAGIC yields denser, more tightly grouped clusters than sc-PHENIX, the authors use DEG-based EMD heatmaps to compare gene expression shifts among dense clusters under the two imputation methods. MAGIC shows mitochondrial (MT) gene over-expression in 4 of 5 dense clusters (clusters 0–3), whereas sc-PHENIX restricts MT over-expression to clusters 0–2 (3 of 10 dense clusters). To rule out sample-size effects causing over-smoothing under MAGIC, they split the data into eleven k-means clusters and obtained the same over-smoothing pattern as in Figure 10A, confirming that MT over-smoothing is indeed a MAGIC artifact; under sc-PHENIX, MT over-expression is not similarly pervasive. VEGFA over-expression is mainly in cluster 2 with sc-PHENIX, while MAGIC shows VEGFA over-expression in cluster 4; in the necrotic context, MT genes and VEGFA mark dying cells with lower UMI counts, with cluster 3 most representative of necrosis due to MT and VEGFA over-expression. Diffusion-imputation reveals data continuity and continuum structure, and the two methods diverge in trajectory topology: sc-PHENIX reveals four branches (4→2, 4→7, 7→5, 3→2) to extreme clusters, whereas MAGIC presents only one branch (0→1→2→3→4) because of over-smoothing. In VIM-CDH-FN1 interactions, extreme cluster 4 suggests a mesenchymal state with CDH1 down-regulation and VIM up-regulation under sc-PHENIX, whereas MAGIC implies proportional increases in VIM and CDH1, a biologically inconsistent pattern likely due to over-smoothing. Across extremely dense clusters, sc-PHENIX shows more diverse differential expression and transition states, with cluster 3 sharing multiple enriched pathways with the invasive cluster 5 and exhibiting the highest HIPOXIA NES value of 3.7935, indicating a transition 3→1→2 toward necrosis; the COAGULATION HALLMARK is enriched in cluster 3 only with sc-PHENIX, aligning with angiogenesis-related invasion in metastatic breast cancer. For extreme clusters 7 and 8, proliferative and invasive hallmarks are present, including OXIDATIVE_PHOSPHORYLATION, ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_LATE, MTORC1_SIGNALING for proliferation, and TNFA_SIGNALING_VIA_NFKB, REACTIVE_OXYGEN_SPECIES_PATHWAY for invasion, while CHOLESTEROL_HOMEOSTASIS uniquely characterizes 7 and 8. Reactome analyses of transition clusters 7 and 8 reveal high NES for REACTOME_CELLULAR_RESPONSE_TO_STARVATION and REACTOME_MITOPHAGY, with mitophagy absent from proliferative/invasive extremes, suggesting a tumor microenvironment where nutrient gradients and energetic stress shape phenotypes. The authors conclude that sc-PHENIX yields richer, more nuanced biological insights than MAGIC or non-imputed data, demonstrating higher resolution and reduced over-smoothing; they also note that these finer insights will be expanded in future work leveraging sc-PHENIX imputation.
