Imputation of scRNA-seq data is essential but inherently prone to over-smoothing, so the authors introduce sc-PHENIX as an enhancement of MAGIC that leverages PCA-UMAP initialization and diffusion maps to better preserve local, global, and continuum structures. They show, across three biological systems and additional non-biological data, that sc-PHENIX maintains global and local organization and a continuum of cell states (as evidenced by the reported continuum structure in the cited figures), whereas MAGIC increasingly distorts structure when knn, t, or PCA dimensions rise. In the MCF7 MCTS dataset, sc-PHENIX reveals hidden heterogeneity and distinct trajectories, including extreme archetypes such as starving (cluster 7) and necrotic (cluster 2), with 3D PCA providing a clearer depiction of these trajectories and extreme phenotypes than t-SNE, UMAP, or PHATE on MAGIC-imputed data, supporting a continuum view of cancer cell states.

Three guiding diffusion-imputation factors are outlined: effectively separating distinct phenotypic densities (local structure), arranging them coherently on the manifold (global structure), and linking them through a valid continuum (continuum structure). PCA-UMAP initialization enables more extensive sharing of information across local neighbors without oversmoothing, allowing higher values of diffusion parameters (t, knn, PCA dimensions) while preserving gene–gene interactions better than MAGIC. Empirical support includes imputation-performance tests over parameter grids, where sc-PHENIX outperforms MAGIC in maintaining cluster structure and continuum organization (as shown in the referenced figures), and mean-squared correlation analyses on artificially corrupted bulk data showing that adding UMAP components improves imputation (Figure 2); 1–3 UMAP components yield the best (lowest) R2, and sc-PHENIX with PCA-UMAP is more robust to high PCA dimensionality than MAGIC (e.g., with n_pca = 71, MAGIC distorts topology whereas PCA-UMAP initialization improves sc-PHENIX). Pure UMAP initialization can underperform (PMBC data) due to over-smoothing of gene–gene interactions, whereas PCA-UMAP initialization preserves them; caution is advised with the 70% variability rule, as using only PCA without this initialization can distort topology in some datasets. The authors argue against universal preservation of Euclidean distances in high-dimensional space (as claimed by Chari et al.), showing that multidimensional PCA can fail to separate distinct phenotypic densities, whereas sc-PHENIX’s manifold-aware separation yields more accurate imputation and richer biological signals. They acknowledge limitations inherited from UMAP (risk of distorted local structure with many cells) and propose remedies such as re-clustering on subsets, while noting that subset-imputation cannot be readily compared across the full dataset; future work may involve alternative manifold-learning methods. Finally, sc-PHENIX already supports various UMAP variants (including supervised UMAP for microbiome data and integration with CITE-seq), with details in the Supplementary Material. Overall, sc-PHENIX offers improved data-structure preservation and denoising over MAGIC, enabling the discovery of new and more nuanced biological insights in both biological and non-biological systems.
