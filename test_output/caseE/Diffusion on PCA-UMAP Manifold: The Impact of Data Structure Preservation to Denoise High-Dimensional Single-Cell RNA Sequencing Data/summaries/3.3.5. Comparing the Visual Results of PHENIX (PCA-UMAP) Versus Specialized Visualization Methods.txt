The authors compare the preservation of local, global, and continuum structure between their visualization approach—MDS plots of the M t derived from diffusion on the PCA-UMAP space of sc-PHENIX—and specialized methods PHATE and UMAP. In PHATE plots of the neuronal dataset and of MNIST, local structure is compromised, with neuronal phenotypes overlapping and, on MNIST, samples of different digits intermingling in dense regions, indicating loss of locality despite some global organization. On MNIST, PHATE retains more global structure than MAGIC and separates digits better than MAGIC, but it does not outperform sc-PHENIX because local continuity is still impaired: extreme regions show 1s connected to 7s and 2s, reflecting disrupted gradual transitions. PHATE also preserves global proximity, placing digits like 7, 4, and 9 near each other and grouping 3, 5, and 8 together, but this comes at the cost of local fidelity. UMAP, shown in supplementary figures, merges digits 4, 7, and 9 into a single large cluster, obscuring substructure and highlighting UMAP’s inadequacy for sustaining continuum structure in 2D. By contrast, sc-PHENIX preserves continuum structure more faithfully while maintaining local distinctions, evidenced by distinct inner branches for each digit in supplementary material. Overall, PHENIX’s PCA-UMAP visualization captures continuity better than MAGIC, but PHATE and UMAP exhibit limitations relative to the preservation of both local and continuum structure achieved by sc-PHENIX.
