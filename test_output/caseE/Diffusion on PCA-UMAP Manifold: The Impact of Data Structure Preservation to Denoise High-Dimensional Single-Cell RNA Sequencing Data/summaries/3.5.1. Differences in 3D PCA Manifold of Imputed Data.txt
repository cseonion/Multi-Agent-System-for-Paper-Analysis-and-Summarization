In this subsection, to identify and characterize the extreme phenotypic states and transition phenotypes in a better-formed structure, the authors compare 3D-PCA plots of imputed data with MAGIC (Figure 10A) and sc-PHENIX (Figure 10B); interactive 3D-PCA plots for MAGIC and sc-PHENIX are provided in Supplementary Material Figures S12 and S13, respectively. They detect and compare dense clusters via HDBSCAN in each 3D-PCA space, finding five dense clusters with MAGIC and ten dense clusters with sc-PHENIX. Downstream analysis includes differential expression by cluster using an EMD score heatmap, a GSEA heatmap with FDR < 0.05 and NES values considered only if positive, and visualization restricted to dense clusters in the imputed 3D-PCA space. The dense clusters under sc-PHENIX are visually more separated than under MAGIC, which yields fewer dense clusters due to cell-grouping; thus near-cluster proximity is interpreted as similar phenotypes, whereas larger distances after sc-PHENIX indicate distinct phenotypes. Sc-PHENIX displays more branches, with four well-defined branches in Figure 10B that could reflect intricate transition states among phenotypes, whereas MAGIC shows no clear trajectory and only a simple trajectory along PC1 and PC2. Regarding extreme phenotypes under sc-PHENIX, the 3D-PCA plot reveals four extremes corresponding to clusters 2, 4, 5, and 7; however, along PC3 these clusters lie in a narrow range, while PC1/PC2 suggest that clusters 0, 2, and 4 could be extreme phenotypes (see Supplementary Figure S12). The authors then proceed to biologically characterize all dense clusters to confirm the biology, focusing on extreme phenotypes and potential intermediate states.
