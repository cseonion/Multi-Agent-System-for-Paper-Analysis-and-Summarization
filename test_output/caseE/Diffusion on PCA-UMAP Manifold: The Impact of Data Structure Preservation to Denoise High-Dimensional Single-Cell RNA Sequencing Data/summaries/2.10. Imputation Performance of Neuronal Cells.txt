We evaluated MAGIC and sc-PHENIX across multiple diffusion parameters and PCA dimensions on the adult mouse visual cortex neuronal dataset from Tasic et al., which comprises 21 well-characterized cell phenotypes and was selected because prior work showed MAGIC can group several phenotypes, making imputation evaluation challenging. A post hoc Tukey’s test was used to compare means while controlling the family-wise error rate with FWRD = 0.05, implemented via pairwise_tukeyhsd from statsmodels. Differential expression for imputed markers was computed with Tukey’s HSD at FWRD = 0.05, evaluating Flt1 (NonNeu_Endo and NonNeu_SMC), Chat (GABA_Vip), Sst (GABA_Sst), and Serpin11 (Gluta_L6B) from imputed data; these markers were determined from Tasic et al. to gauge imputation quality. A confusion matrix was created for each imputation from MAGIC and sc-PHENIX using various parameter combinations, recording whether each marker was differentially expressed (1) or not (0), and from these matrices precision, recall, and f1-score were derived—the higher these metrics, the better the imputation preserves gene expression across phenotypes. The authors note that over-smoothing evaluations are relevant for scRNA-seq imputation benchmarking, though not a quality-control metric, and Supplementary Material: Methods S1 provides a visual diagram of imputation performance.
