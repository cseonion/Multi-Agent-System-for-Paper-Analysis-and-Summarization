This section assesses imputation on the 3D Multicellular Cancer Tumor Spheroids of the breast cancer cell line MCF7 (MCF7 MCTS) scRNA-seq data across two growth timepoints (days 6 and 19) to compare MAGIC and sc-PHENIX. The authors impute and evaluate recovered biological insights by reporting precision, recall, and F1 for imputation across different combinations of knn, t, and PCA dimensions, using Flt1 for NonNeu_Endo/NonNeu_SMC, Chat for GABA_Vip, Sst for GABA_Sst, and Serpin11 for Gluta_L6B, with differential expression thresholds Fold Change = 2.0 and FWRD = 0.05 via Tukeyâ€™s HSD. To modulate PCA influence they note that knn = 15 and t = 15 increase PCA effects; knn = 15 with n_pca = 30 increases t; and knn = 15 with PCA = 30 increases knn, referencing prior figures. In parallel, they impute the MCF7 MCTS data to reevaluate biological insights and perform a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, identifying three subpopulations without imputation: invasive, proliferative, and reservoir. The invasive phenotype exhibits immune-adaptive characteristics, the proliferative phenotype drives growth, and the reservoir may be a transitional phenotype sharing proliferation and invasion pathways.
