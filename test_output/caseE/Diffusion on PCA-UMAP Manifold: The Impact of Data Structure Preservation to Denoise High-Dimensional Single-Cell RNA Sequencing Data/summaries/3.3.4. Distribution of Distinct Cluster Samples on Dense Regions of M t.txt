This section extends beyond the MDS view by directly probing the density structure of the M_t embeddings using MNIST as a test manifold. The authors apply HDBSCAN to the distance matrices derived from PCA space and from PCA-derived PCA-UMAP space, with M_t constructed in both PCA space and PCA-UMAP space, to identify dense regions and assess whether observed agglomerations reflect true structure or distorting artifacts. They argue that the spurious clustering seen in multidimensional PCA (and in MAGIC’s M_t) arises from distance concentration or distortion of the data, and that a density-based criterion can reveal the real manifold structure.

Results in PCA space show only one dense cluster corresponding to the digit “1”; nearly all other MNIST samples are labeled as noise, aligning with the visual density seen in prior figures. In diffusion on PCA space, a single dense cluster (Cluster A) contains almost all samples, with a minority deemed noise. By contrast, diffusion on PCA-UMAP space yields seven distinct density clusters (A–G), indicating clearer separation of diverse digits. This non-visual evidence suggests that the M_t computed for sc-PHENIX with PCA-UMAP initialization can better disentangle true dense clusters and reflect underlying manifold structure. The authors also note that the accompanying non-visual analysis of MAGIC’s M_t (Figure 4) shows multiple distinct phenotypes being grouped erroneously due to inadequate PCA initialization, rather than the MDS approach itself. Overall, density-based clustering via HDBSCAN corroborates that PCA-UMAP–initialized M_t captures more faithful structure and mitigates spurious agglomeration.
