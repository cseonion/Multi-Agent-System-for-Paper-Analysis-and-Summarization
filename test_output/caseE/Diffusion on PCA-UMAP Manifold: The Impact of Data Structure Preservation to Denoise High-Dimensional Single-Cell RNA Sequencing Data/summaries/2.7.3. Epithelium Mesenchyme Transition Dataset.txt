The EMT dataset comprises single-cell RNA sequencing data generated with the inDrop method from the HMLE breast cancer cell line undergoing epithelial–mesenchymal transition, capturing 7,523 cells and 28,910 genes at 8 and 10 days after TGF-β stimulation. The data were derived from the original MAGIC publication and are used here to evaluate the reproducibility of sc-PHENIX compared to MAGIC when sc-PHENIX is initialized with PCA. Source data include the GitHub MAGIC dataset HMLE_TGFb_day_8_10.csv.gz and GEO accession GSE114397. Preprocessing followed the MAGIC article using the scprep library, with library-size normalization and filtering via scprep.normalize.library_size_normalize() and scprep.filter.filter_library_size(cutoff = 1500). Scprep is a Python framework for loading, preprocessing, and visualizing single-cell data. Imputation parameters were t = 6, knn = 30, decay = 15, and the first 20 PCA dimensions.
