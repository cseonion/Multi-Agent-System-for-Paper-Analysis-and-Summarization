Section 3.3.2 evaluates how MAGIC and sc-PHENIX preserve continuum structure by examining imputed gene–gene interactions in the 10x human PBMC scRNA-seq dataset, which includes nine characterized immune phenotypes and an analysis of the naive-to-memory CD4+ T transition marked by CCR7 and IL7R. The study found that MAGIC distorts CCR7 downregulation through over-smoothing across distinct phenotypes, compromising the continuum, whereas sc-PHENIX with PCA–UMAP initialization largely preserves CCR7 downregulation across most parameter combinations, supporting better continuum recovery. To quantify structure, they used 2D MDS plots of the diffusion-transformed matrix M_t and, for robustness, analyzed the neuronal dataset via a KNN classifier to measure local-structure preservation across parameter settings, with supplementary visual analyses in Sections S3–S5. Supplementary S5 shows that, for MAGIC in PCA space, three main neuronal clusters—GABAergic, glutamatergic, and non-neuronal—overlap under various diffusion parameter configurations, and increasing knn, t, or the number of PCA dimensions degrades local structure, consistent with diffusion-induced distortion described by Mukherjee et al. Conversely, PCA–UMAP M_t plots for sc-PHENIX exhibit diminished distortion and clearer separation, especially between GABAergic and glutamatergic clusters, indicating preserved local structure. To compare methods, they evaluated 250 parameter combinations (125 per method) using KNN accuracy across 2D MDS embeddings, with results summarized in Figure 6: sc-PHENIX consistently yields higher accuracy than MAGIC across most configurations, attaining its best performance with higher PCA dimensions (100, 200, 500) and moderate-to-high knn values as t increases, highlighting superior local-structure preservation under these conditions; MAGIC performs worse, with accuracy dropping at low knn and high PCA dimensions and no consistent gains from increasing t, given its default t = 3. Overall, the findings indicate that sc-PHENIX is more robust than MAGIC in preserving local structure and achieving higher accuracy across parameter spaces, with the best results for sc-PHENIX at larger PCA dimensions and higher knn, underscoring the importance of parameter choice in optimizing imputation for scRNA-seq data; embedding details for each parameter set are provided in Supplementary Materials S5.
