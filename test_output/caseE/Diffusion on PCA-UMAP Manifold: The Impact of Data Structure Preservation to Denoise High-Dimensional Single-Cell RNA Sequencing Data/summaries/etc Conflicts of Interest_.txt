In this section, the authors used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to link imputed gene expression patterns, derived from dense clusters in MAGIC and sc-PHENIX on the MCF7 multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS), to biological pathways. They applied GSEA to the EMD score of each dense cluster, comparing non-imputed data (21 HALLMARK pathways) with imputed data (MAGIC: 41 HALLMARKS; sc-PHENIX: 45 HALLMARKS), finding more than 20 new HALLMARKS unveiled by imputation (Supplementary Table S1). MAGIC’s over-smoothing did not yield more HALLMARKS than sc-PHENIX, indicating that sc-PHENIX’s sharing of gene information among truly similar cells reveals more HALLMARKS without excessive smoothing; four new HALLMARKS appear only with sc-PHENIX: XENOBIOTIC_METABOLISM (clusters 6 and 10), WNT_BETA_CATENIN_SIGNALING (cluster 5), APICAL_JUNCITON (cluster 3 and 6), and COAGULATION (clusters 1 and 3), as shown in Figure 10B and Tables S1–S2 and not present in non-imputed or MAGIC analyses. Building on these HALLMARKs, the authors categorize phenotypes into invasive, proliferative, transition, and necrotic states, with invasive-related HALLMARKs including REACTIVE_OXYGEN_SPECIES_PATHWAY, INTERFERON_ALPHA_RESPONSE, INTERFERON_GAMMA_RESPONSE, INFLAMMATORY_RESPONSE, APOPTOSIS, and HYPOXIA, and proliferative HALLMARKS such as E2F_TARGETS, G2M_CHECKPOINT, MITOTIC_SPINDLE, GLYCOLYSIS, and OXIDATIVE_PHOSPHORYLATION; transition shows a mix, while necrosis is characterized by comparatively few HALLMARKs. MAGIC associates the proliferative phenotype with clusters 0–3 and the invasive phenotype with cluster 4, but over-smoothing obscures transitions and microenvironmental context like hypoxia, with MT genes over-expressed in clusters 0–3 supporting proliferation and necrosis not clearly explained by the limited HALLMARKs. In contrast, sc-PHENIX reveals a broader repertoire of extreme phenotypes; necrotic-like states appear in clusters 0–3 where MT genes and VEGFA are over-smoothed, cluster 3 is the least represented for necrosis, and a transition from cluster 10 toward cluster 4 accompanies several inflammatory HALLMARK pathways, with APOPTOSIS HALLMARKs present in clusters 3 and 5. These patterns align with UMAP visualizations of phenotype markers (Figure 8C) and CCR7–IL7R interactions in PBMC data discussed in Section S1. Section S10 provides an interactive dashboard of HDBSCAN clusters across t-SNE, UMAP, PHATE, and 3D PCA embeddings, visualizing imputed VEGFA, ANLN, HIF1A, and NACA—genes representative of extreme sc-PHENIX clusters (as shown in the EMD heatmap for Figure 10)—using the same HDBSCAN clustering as Figure 10 for MAGIC and sc-PHENIX; in MCF7 cell lines and tumor spheroids, VEGFA, ANLN, HIF1A, and NACA occupy distinct extreme phenotypes in sc-PHENIX imputed data, underscoring their roles in angiogenesis, cytokinesis, hypoxic adaptation, and stress response. The section also references supplementary materials, including Table S1 (Unique HALLMARKS), Table S2 (GSEA results by HALLMARKS), and Sections S1–S8, MNIST analyses, and the MDPI link, with no conflicts of interest reported.
