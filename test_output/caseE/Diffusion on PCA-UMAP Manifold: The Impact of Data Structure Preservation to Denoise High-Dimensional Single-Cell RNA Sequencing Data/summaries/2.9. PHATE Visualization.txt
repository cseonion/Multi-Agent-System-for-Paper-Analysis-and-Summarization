To evaluate their visualization method, the authors compared it with PHATE (Potential of Heat Diffusion for Affinity-based Transition Embedding). PHATE is designed to preserve local, global, and continuum structures in low-dimensional embeddings using a unique informational distance metric, and it incorporates PCA preprocessing to enhance robustness and reliability. They applied PHATE to the MNIST dataset (knn = 5, n_pca = 500, n_components = 2) and to the Neuronal dataset (knn = 30, n_pca = 500, with n_components = 3 and 2) as benchmarks.
