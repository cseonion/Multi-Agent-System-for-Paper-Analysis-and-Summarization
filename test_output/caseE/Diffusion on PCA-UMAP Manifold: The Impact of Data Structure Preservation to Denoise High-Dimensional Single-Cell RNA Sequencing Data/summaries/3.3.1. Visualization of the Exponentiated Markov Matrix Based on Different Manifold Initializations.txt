Section 3.3.1 investigates how the exponentiated Markov matrix M^t, the diffusion step underlying methods like MAGIC and sc-PHENIX, represents data structure when initialized on different manifolds (PCA versus PCA–UMAP). Exponentiating the transition matrix yields a low-pass filter that boosts affinities among similar samples while down-weighting spurious neighbors, and defines a diffusion graph over random walks of any length t that has been used for imputation on PCA space; however, MAGIC preprocessing can distort the low-dimensional manifold by merging distinct cell types, so the authors evaluate diffusion-induced distortion by visualizing M^t with multidimensional scaling (MDS) projections, distinguishing PCA M^t (PCAM^t) from PCA–UMAP M^t (PCA–UMAP M^t). They compare two datasets: MNIST, chosen for its clear cluster structure in low-D space, and the adult mouse visual cortex neuronal dataset (Tasic et al.), used to assess preservation of local structure and to illustrate MAGIC-induced phenotypic grouping and how sc-PHENIX mitigates it. The analysis presents several visualization panels, including a three-dimensional MDS plot of M^t with 500 PCs mapped into 60 UMAP components (knn = 50, t = 10), a two-dimensional MDS plot for MAGIC (500 PCs input, knn = 30, t = 5), and a two-dimensional MDS plot for sc-PHENIX (500 PCs transformed into 60 UMAP components, knn = 50, t = 10), along with images illustrating MNIST digits to reflect continuum and branch structure. The findings show that for MNIST, PCA–UMAP M^t better captures local and continuum structure, whereas PCA M^t preserves global structure more effectively; for the scRNA-seq data, PCA M^t preserves some global structure but poorly preserves local structure due to mixing neighboring regions of different cluster densities, while PCA–UMAP M^t improves local and continuum representation. In the neuronal dataset, local structure distortion is evident in PCA M^t because GABAergic and glutamatergic phenotypes cluster together and non-neuronal phenotypes can lie near neuronal ones; this MAGIC-induced distortion is mitigated by PCA–UMAP M^t, which yields clearer separation of the main neuronal clusters and better preservation of local structure. Globally, MNIST shows comparable global structure across PCA space and M^t representations, while in the neuronal data the PCA–UMAP M^t embedding better preserves global structure by separating non-neuronal clusters from neuronal phenotypes. Finally, continuum structure is visually evaluated for MNIST, revealing density-driven continuation along the manifold, whereas continuum was not assessed for the neuronal dataset due to unconnected phenotypes and limited samples, a condition requiring pseudotime methods and making it difficult to evaluate t, knn, and PCA combinations for MAGIC and sc-PHENIX solely in local/global terms.
