After M is computed by row-normalization, diffusion proceeds by exponentiating M to M^t, with t defined as the diffusion time; M^t(i,j) is the probability that a random walk of length t from cell i will reach cell j. This diffusion strengthens weights among phenotypically similar cells and down-weights spurious neighbors, filtering out noise such as dropouts, artifacts, and uneven transcript capture that lack structure on the manifold; as t grows, diffusion better recovers the manifold and removes noisy dimensions. Imputation is then performed by the matrix product M^t and D (Eq. 5). The study finds that a PCA-based initialization for M^t fails to separate distinct phenotypes adequately, causing over-smoothing and limiting information sharing to only a few local neighbors, which undermines biological insights and yields poorly structured gene-gene interactions as observed with MAGIC, especially at lower t. In contrast, a PCA-UMAP initialization (sc-PHENIX) effectively separates phenotypes, enabling more comprehensive cell-graph imputation and allowing information sharing in a more local setting with higher values of t, knn, or PCA dimensions; this approach reduces over-smoothing and uncovers local details of cell types that non-imputation methods and MAGIC miss.
