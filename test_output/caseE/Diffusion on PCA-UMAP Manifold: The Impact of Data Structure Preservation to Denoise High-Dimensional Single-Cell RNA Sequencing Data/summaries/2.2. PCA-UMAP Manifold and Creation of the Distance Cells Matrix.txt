This section describes constructing the diffusion distance for sc-PHENIX by leveraging a PCA-UMAP manifold. Starting from the preprocessed count matrix D, PCA is used to initialize UMAP, producing the PCA-UMAP space matrix D_PCA-UMAP. Because UMAP embeddings can be interpreted as Euclidean projections, a Euclidean distance matrix D_Dist is computed in this PCA-UMAP space to drive diffusion and prevent oversmoothing. The key distinction from MAGIC is that sc-PHENIX uses the PCA-UMAP space rather than PCA alone to compute D_Dist, and users can employ alternative manifold initializations. PCA serves as a critical initialization that preserves global and local structure, yielding a meaningful low-dimensional representation for imputation. Caution is given against very low-dimensional UMAP (2D or 3D), as these may not preserve high-dimensional distances; this is supported in Section 3.2, where imputing high-dimensional bulk data with 80% artificial zeros using more than n_components = 3 (UMAP dimensions) yields higher R^2 between imputed and original data. UMAPâ€™s embedding dimension can be three components or more, aligned with the underlying scRNA-seq data manifold to enhance clustering and downstream analyses. Figure 1A and 1B depict the workflow used to compute the matrices for imputation.
