This Nature Neuroscience dataset delineates a cellular taxonomy of the adult mouse primary visual cortex using single-cell RNA sequencing, identifying 49 transcriptomic cell types comprising 23 GABAergic, 19 glutamatergic, and 7 non-neuronal types, across 24,057 genes and 1,679 cells.

Preprocessing used RPKM normalization, with imputation parameters varied according to combinations of t, knn, and PCA dimensions; MAGIC parameters were default. For sc-PHENIX, UMAP parameters were n_components = 5, n_neighbors = 14, verbose = True, metric = 'cosine', min_dist = 0.2, n_epochs = 1000, negative_sample_rate = 5. To visualize the imputed data, a 2D-UMAP was created from the non-imputed data to observe imputed-cell behavior, with non-imputed data 2D-UMAP parameters: n_components = 2, n_neighbors = 10, verbose = True, metric = 'cosine', min_dist = 0.5, n_epochs = 1500, negative_sample_rate = 5, set_op_mix_ratio = 0.8, learning_rate = 0.1, local_connectivity = 3, random_state = 42; input was the RPKM-normalized data. Imputation was then performed on this dataset using knn-smoothing parameters based on varying PCA and knn values.
