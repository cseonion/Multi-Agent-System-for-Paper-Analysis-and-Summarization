We performed quality control prior to imputation (MAGIC or sc-PHENIX), including filtering out low-quality cells, discarding empty droplets in droplet-based technologies, and removing empty genes. We then applied library size normalization to obtain the scRNA-seq input for the imputation method. Preprocessing steps for each dataset are described in Sections 2.6 and 2.7. Normalization tailored to the technology reduces cell-size biases and ensures that the weighted neighborhood construction remains unbiased [5]. The sc-PHENIX input is the raw or preprocessed expression matrix (D) (Figure 1A). Lytal et al. suggest library size normalization is particularly well-suited for scRNA-seq data, but we provide flexibility for end users to choose the normalization method [26]. If users apply MAGIC, we recommend using the normalization approach described by Van Dijk et al. [5].
