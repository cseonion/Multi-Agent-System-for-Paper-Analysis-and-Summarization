The current section applies GSEA to the EMD score of each dense cluster for MAGIC and sc-PHENIX on the MCF7 MCTS to link imputed gene expression patterns with biological pathways. Non-imputed data yield 21 HALLMARK pathways, MAGIC yields 41, and sc-PHENIX yields 45, with imputation uncovering more than 20 new HALLMARKs (Supplementary Materials: Table S1). Four HALLMARKs appear only with sc-PHENIX: XENOBIOTIC_METABOLISM (clusters 6 and 10), WNT_BETA_CATENIN_SIGNALING (cluster 5), APICAL_JUNCITON (clusters 3 and 6), and COAGULATION (clusters 1 and 3), as shown in Figure 10B and Tables S1–S2. Based on these HALLMARKs, the authors delineate invasive, proliferative, transition, and necrotic phenotypes, with invasive-related HALLMARKs including REACTIVE_OXYGEN_SPECIES_PATHWAY, INTERFERON_ALPHA_RESPONSE, INTERFERON_GAMMA_RESPONSE, INFLAMMATORY_RESPONSE, APOPTOSIS, and HYPOXIA, and proliferative HALLMARKS such as E2F_TARGETS, G2M_CHECKPOINT, MITOTIC_SPINDLE, GLYCOLYSIS, and OXIDATIVE_PHOSPHORYLATION; transition shows a mix, while necrosis is characterized by comparatively few HALLMARKs. MAGIC associates the proliferative phenotype with clusters 0–3 and the invasive phenotype with cluster 4, but over-smoothing obscures transitions and microenvironmental context like hypoxia, with MT genes over-expressed in clusters 0–3 supporting proliferation and necrosis not clearly explained by the limited HALLMARKs. In contrast, sc-PHENIX reveals a broader repertoire of extreme phenotypes; necrotic-like states appear in clusters 0–3 where MT genes and VEGFA are over-smoothed, cluster 3 is the least represented for necrosis, and a transition from cluster 10 toward cluster 4 accompanies several inflammatory HALLMARK pathways, with APOPTOSIS HALLMARKs appearing in clusters 3 and 5. These phenotype patterns are also supported by UMAP visualization of phenotype markers (Figure 8C) and the CCR7–IL7R interaction in PBMC data discussed in Section S1. Section S10 provides an interactive dashboard of HDBSCAN clusters across t-SNE, UMAP, PHATE, and 3D PCA embeddings, visualizing imputed VEGFA, ANLN, HIF1A, and NACA—genes representative of extreme sc-PHENIX clusters (as shown in the EMD heatmap for Figure 10)—with the same HDBSCAN clustering as Figure 10 for MAGIC and sc-PHENIX; in the MCF7 cell lines and tumor spheroids, VEGFA, ANLN, HIF1A, and NACA occupy distinct extreme phenotypes in the sc-PHENIX imputed data, underscoring their roles in angiogenesis, cytokinesis, hypoxic adaptation, and stress response. The section also notes supplementary materials including Table S1 (Unique HALLMARKS), Table S2 (GSEA results by HALLMARKS), other sections (S1–S8), MNIST analyses, and the MDPI link; and the authors report no conflicts of interest.
