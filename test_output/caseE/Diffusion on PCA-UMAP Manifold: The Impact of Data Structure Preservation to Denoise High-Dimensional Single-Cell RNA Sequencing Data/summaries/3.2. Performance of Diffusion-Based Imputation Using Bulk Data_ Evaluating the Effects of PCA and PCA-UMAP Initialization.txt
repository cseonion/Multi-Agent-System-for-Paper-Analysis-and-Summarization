This section investigates how PCA initialization (as in MAGIC) versus PCA-UMAP initialization (as proposed here) affects diffusion-based imputation performance on bulk data, using 206 developmentally synchronized C. elegans samples with 80% random zeros introduced to simulate dropout, spanning a 12-hour developmental trajectory measured by microarrays. We compare two PCA-based neighbor settings, knn = 30 (high) and knn = 5 (low), fixing t = 5 and decay = 15 for the high/low comparisons in Figures 2A, 2B, and 2C. In Figure 2A (high knn), 2B (mixed knn: MAGIC knn = 5, sc-PHENIX knn = 30), and 2C (low knn), sc-PHENIX consistently outperforms MAGIC in terms of Pearson, Spearman, and R2 across the number of PCA components, with the orange vs blue curves and 95% CIs indicating robustness; specifically, the Pearson AUC values are 0.76 for sc-PHENIX versus 0.68 for MAGIC in 2A, 0.76 versus 0.72 in 2B, and 0.71 versus 0.72 in 2C. However, in the low knn regime, MAGIC initially outperforms sc-PHENIX at small numbers of PCA components (roughly >10 but <25), while sc-PHENIX starts lower when fewer than ~100 PCA components are used but improves with more PCs, rarely surpassing MAGIC at very low dimensionality. Overall, the AUC analysis shows little difference between methods in the low-knn scenario, suggesting comparable robustness to PCA dimensionality, whereas MAGIC benefits from low PCA dimensionality and low knn, while sc-PHENIX gains with higher PCA dimensionality and higher knn, generally outperforming MAGIC as dimensionality grows.

We further evaluated PCA-UMAP initialization by fixing t = 5, decay = 5, n_pca = 71, and knn = 30. In this setup, PCA-UMAP initialization yields better performance for sc-PHENIX than UMAP alone across all three metrics, and increasing the number of UMAP dimensions improves robustness, with at least three dimensions sustaining performance in this small, topologically simple dataset. Figure 2H shows that 71 PCA components capture about 70% of the dropout data variance (as indicated in Figure 2J), guiding the choice of n_pca = 71 to align with MAGIC’s recommendation. Under this regime, MAGIC’s performance worsens with more than 71 PCA components due to over-smoothing, whereas PCA-UMAP for sc-PHENIX mitigates this risk, highlighting sc-PHENIX’s robustness to PCA dimensionality when paired with PCA-UMAP initialization.

The analysis emphasizes that sc-PHENIX’s performance is robust to PCA dimensionality and benefits from higher knn, enabling broad-imputation improvements over MAGIC across most settings. At the gene level, local knn-based localization of expression with sc-PHENIX preserves low or zero values and avoids the over-smoothing observed with MAGIC, as illustrated for three genes (C27A7.6, dct-5, erd-2) in the 2D UMAP plots and accompanying trend visualizations. When examining developmental-time trajectories with varying knn, sc-PHENIX preserves the overall trend while MAGIC increasingly blurs distinctions with higher knn due to diffusion-like smoothing. Although sc-PHENIX can lose some sensitivity to very low expression when knn is very high, it generally maintains clearer groupings and transitions than MAGIC. The study also compared initialization strategies beyond PCA-UMAP, including PCA-tSNE, full t-SNE, and Laplacian Eigenmaps-UMAP; none outperformed PCA-UMAP or UMAP-based initialization, with t-SNE constrained to three dimensions and occasionally underperforming relative to UMAP-based approaches. Finally, varying the decay parameter produced a modest AUC improvement (~0.01) when explored alongside higher PCA dimensionality, reinforcing that the best practical pairing is a low knn for MAGIC and a high knn for sc-PHENIX, with clearer separation between methods demonstrated in the extended Figure 3.
