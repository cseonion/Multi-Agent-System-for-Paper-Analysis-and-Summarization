This section describes how the PCA space and the exponentiated transition matrix Mt (from PCA and PCAâ€“UMAP initialization) are transformed into a distance matrix D_dist to enable multidimensional scaling (MDS; see Fig. 1C). To minimize stress efficiently and preserve high-dimensional distances in the low-dimensional manifold, the authors employ the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm from a referenced approach, which can project data from a distance matrix into 2D or 3D spaces and has been shown to achieve lower stress more quickly than majorization without relying on a good initialization. Since MAGIC provides only the imputed matrix and not Mt, Mt for MAGIC is inferred indirectly by computing Mt via sc-PHENIX with PCA initialization (details in Supplementary Material S1). For the neuronal dataset, several 2D plots are generated from the Mt of MAGIC and sc-PHENIX under various combinations of PCA dimensions, t, and knn values to evaluate cluster structure preservation. A KNeighborsClassifier with knn = 30 from scikit-learn is used to assess local structure by predicting 21 phenotype labels from the 2D embeddings, thereby quantifying how well the 2D projections retain the underlying cluster structure.
