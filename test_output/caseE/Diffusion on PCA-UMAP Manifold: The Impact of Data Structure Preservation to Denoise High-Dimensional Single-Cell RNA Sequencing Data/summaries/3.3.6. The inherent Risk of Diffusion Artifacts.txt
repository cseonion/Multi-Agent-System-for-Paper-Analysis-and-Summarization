This section argues that diffusion artifacts arise when the manifold initialization is poorly suited, such as PCA space, which creates spurious connections between densities of distinct clusters due to a small density gap in PCA space, as seen in the poor separation reported in Figures 4D and 5A and Supplementary Material S5. It shows that PCA alone does not separate densities well enough to prevent diffusion-induced connections (Figure 4A), with sparsity driving the near-neighbor densities of different clusters closer together (Supplementary Material S6). Moreover, diffusion approaches based on PCA (PHATE) distort the manifold when data have high missingness, whereas PCA-UMAP is more suitable for separating distinct clusters in sparse data (S6). As a result, PCA-UMAP initialization solves the major issue for accurately constructing M_t using only PCA initialization, which matters because sc-PHENIX and MAGIC require the manifold embedded in M_t for the final imputation step (Figure 1B, matrix multiplication). To avoid over-smoothing from sharing information among spurious nearest neighbors, M_t must capture the data’s local, global, and continuum structure as fully as possible. Consequently, the authors recommend sc-PHENIX using PCA-UMAP (Figure 4D) space rather than PCA alone to address the major issues caused by MAGIC’s diffusion on PCA space (Figure 4C). Finally, preserving data structures in diffusion methods is crucial for detecting and handling rare phenotypes among ubiquitous cells in transcriptomic space; rare phenotypes reside in low-density regions due to rapid phenotype transitions and are transient, as noted with reference [48].
