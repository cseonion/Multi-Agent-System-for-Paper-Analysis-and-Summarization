The results are organized into four subsections that compare sc-PHENIX with MAGIC across multiple facets. In Section 3.2, Performance of Diffusion-Based Imputation, the authors assess how PCA and PCA-UMAP initialization influence imputation using bulk transcriptomic data, sweeping parameter settings such as t, knn, and PCA dimensions to evaluate performance. In Section 3.3, Visualization with sc-PHENIX, they provide visualizations illustrating that sc-PHENIX minimizes over-smoothing relative to MAGIC, using datasets including MNIST and neuronal data, and also presenting PBMC analyses to illustrate effects on geneâ€“gene interactions. In Section 3.4, Evaluation of Over-Smoothing, they analyze marker integrity across neuronal phenotypes to compare how well each method preserves marker signals without excessive smoothing. Finally, Section 3.5, Evaluation of the Heterogeneity of MCF7 Cells Data, examines spheroid heterogeneity, discusses differences in 3D PCA manifolds and dense clusters, and notes that sc-PHENIX captures more transition states and extreme phenotypes than MAGIC.
