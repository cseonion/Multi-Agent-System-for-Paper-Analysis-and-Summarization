To assess the imputation accuracy of MAGIC and sc-PHENIX, the authors built a validation dataset from bulk transcriptomic data of 206 synchronized C. elegans young adults, measured at regular intervals over a 12-hour developmental period using microarrays. They modified the approach by randomly and uniformly inserting zeros, exponentiated the log-scaled expression levels matrix, and downsampled each entry to retain 80% of the original data. The introduction of zeros causes samples to cluster more, complicating the computation of similarities and thus challenging both imputation methods. They chose to use this corrupted count matrix after exponentiation because the matrix prior to zero insertion preserves developmental time order and the continuum structure. Regarding dropout, although in scRNA-seq dropout occurs randomly with any transcript having an equal chance of being missed and is more likely for low expression, even highly expressed genes may not be detected in all cells; the authors expect the remaining data to still contain sufficient information to accurately compute similarities for imputation.
