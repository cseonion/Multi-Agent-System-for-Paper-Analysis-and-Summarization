This section evaluates over-smoothing using the adult mouse visual cortex dataset, which has three main cell phenotypes (GABAergic, glutamatergic, non-neuronal) and 21 sub-phenotypes, with known differential markers to test whether imputation preserves marker distinctions. The authors compare MAGIC and sc-PHENIX across multiple parameter combinations (t, knn, and the number of PCA dimensions) to avoid biased conclusions based on default settings. They focus on markers Flt1 (endothelial/smooth muscle), Vip and Chat (Vip cells), Sst (Sst cells), and Serpinb11 (Gluta_L6b). In Figure 8A–C, both methods’ recovery of Flt1 is shown on the UMAP, revealing that increasing knn, t, and PCA dimensions worsens over-smoothing with MAGIC, while sc-PHENIX maintains marker expression within their respective clusters; similar results hold for Vip, Sst, and Chat (supplementary Fig. S11). To quantify performance, they compute precision, recall, and F1 using Flt1 for NonNeu_Endo/NonNeu_SMC, Sst for GABA_Sst, Chat for GABA_Vip, and Serpin11 for Gluta_L6B, with a differential expression criterion of Fold Change = 2.0 and FWRD = 0.05 via Tukey’s HSD. They report that MAGIC’s performance deteriorates as parameters and PCA dimensions increase, whereas sc-PHENIX does not sacrifice performance and avoids oversmoothing, consistently better preserving marker separation as shown in M_t MDS plots and Figure 5D’s PCA-UMAP initialization. In contrast, MAGIC with PCA initialization fails to provide good imputation across any parameter combination, over-smoothing all markers even with conservative (low knn and t) settings, aligning with artifacts reported in prior work. The results are supported by precision, recall, and F1 trends across parameter grids, with explicit notes on how adjusting knn, t, and n_pca (e.g., knn = 15 and t = 15 to boost PCA effects; knn = 15 with n_pca = 30 to raise t; or knn = 15 and PCA = 30 to raise knn) influences the reported metrics. Overall, the section demonstrates that sc-PHENIX, using PCA-UMAP initialization, better preserves cell-phenotype–specific marker expression and avoids over-smoothing compared with MAGIC across diverse diffusion parameter regimes.
