The tumor spheroid dataset comprises 364 cells and 23,922 genes, with raw data and the count matrix available through GEO accession GSE145633; the data correspond to the same resource used in the sc-PHENIX evaluation and were accessed on 4 June 2024. A limitation of MAGIC is that it can yield a low-dimensional manifold for initialization when pre-filtering by most variable genes, potentially excluding significant genes during imputation; for example, filtering at the 85th percentile may remove the VIM marker and many transcription factors and membrane receptors due to low abundance, since genuine biological differences are assumed to manifest as increased variation among these genes. Opportunity exists in sc-PHENIX to recover all genes while creating a PCA-UMAP initialization from the most variable genes, enabling interrogation of gene–gene interactions and dropout and filtration effects that masking with most-variable-gene filtering would otherwise obscure; in MAGIC van Dijk et al. used all genes to recover EMT data, providing a basis for comparing these approaches. For MAGIC imputation, the initial count matrix (23,922 genes) was library-size normalized with scprep, square-root transformed, then imputed with t = 5 and knn = 20, using 100 PCA dimensions from the preprocessed matrix. In contrast, sc-PHENIX starts from a library-size-normalized count matrix that is square-root transformed; for PCA–UMAP initialization, the data are filtered to the top variable genes via scprep.select.highly_variable_genes(data_sqrt, percentile = 85), reduced to 30 PCA components and 30 UMAP components, with UMAP configured as n_components = 30, metric = 'euclidean', n_epochs = 1000, min_dist = 0.5, verbose = 1, random_state = 1; imputation uses t = 5, decay = 5, and knn = 20. Phenotype characterization focused on MCF7 clusters: after preprocessing, imputation results from MAGIC and sc-PHENIX were compared across all genes; extreme phenotypes were explored by embedding the imputed data in a 3D PCA space, followed by archetypal analysis to identify extremal points that are convex combinations of observations. In this 3D space, HDBSCAN was applied to the PCA projections to locate dense clusters near archetypes, labeling noise as -1, thereby facilitating visualization of cellular states at the manifold’s edges. Differences in gene expression across clusters for the imputed data were quantified with Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) for differential expression by clusters (one-vs-all, i.e., first Wasserstein distance), with the EMD score defined as EMD × sign(mean difference) to indicate direction, computed using scprep. For downstream interpretation, WebGestalt was used to perform gene set enrichment analysis on the EMD-derived scores, restricting to MSigDB Hallmark gene sets (h.all.v7.5.1.symbols.gmt) and REACTOME (c2.cp.reactome.v2022.1.Hs.symbols.gmt), and setting significance at FDR < 0.05 with p = 0; enrichment results were reported with their NES values. Using EMD instead of means avoids biases from multimodal distributions in scRNA-seq, enabling more robust GSEA conclusions.
