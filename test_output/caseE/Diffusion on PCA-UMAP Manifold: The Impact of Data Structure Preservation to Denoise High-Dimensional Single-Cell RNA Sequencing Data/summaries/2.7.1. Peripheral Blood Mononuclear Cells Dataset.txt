This section describes a dataset of 3,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a healthy donor, with RNA content of about 1 pg per cell, of which 2,700 cells were detected. The data come from the 10x Genomics pbmc3k resource (accessed via the specified URL). Preprocessing follows the Seurat tutorial: quality control, normalization by library size, and a Log +1 transformation. Additionally, data were imputed using SAVER with default parameters, and for knn-smoothing, the authors varied the PCA and knn values based on the preprocessed matrix.
