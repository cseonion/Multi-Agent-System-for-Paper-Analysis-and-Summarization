논문 제목: DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning
섹션: 5.. Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work
==================================================

Section 5, “Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work,” synthesizes the empirical trajectory of DeepSeek-R1 by tying together the RL-driven and distillation-based avenues for enhancing reasoning in large language models, and it lays out concrete directions to broaden and refine these approaches.

- Key conclusions and contributions
  - Pure reinforcement learning path: DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates that a purely RL-based approach can achieve strong reasoning performance without cold-start data. When augmented with cold-start data and iterative RL fine-tuning, DeepSeek-R1 becomes even more capable, ultimately delivering performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217 across a range of tasks.
  - Distillation as a scalable complement: Using DeepSeek-R1 as the teacher, 800K training samples are generated to fine-tune compact dense models. The resulting DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model outperforms large instruction-tuned models on math benchmarks (28.9% on AIME, 83.9% on MATH), with other dense models also showing strong results. This underscores distillation as a practical path to transfer reasoning capability to smaller models while maintaining competitive performance.

- Connection to the paper’s overarching theme
  - The section reinforces the paper’s central narrative: incentive-based reasoning can elevate capability, and while RL-based approaches show promise, distillation from strong base models offers a scalable route for deployment at smaller sizes. This aligns with the earlier discussion in Section 4.2, which framed distillation as a more practical, scalable alternative given the challenges of scaling more speculative incentive-based methods like PRM or MCTS.

- Limitations and explicit future directions
  - General capability gap: DeepSeek-R1 trails DeepSeek-V3 on tasks requiring function calling, multi-turn dialogue, complex role-playing, and JSON output. The authors plan to investigate how longer chain-of-thought (CoT) processes can bolster performance in these areas.
  - Language mixing: While optimized for Chinese and English, other languages may trigger language mixing (e.g., reasoning in English for non-English queries). Future work will address multilingual robustness.
  - Prompting engineering sensitivity: DeepSeek-R1 is prompt-sensitive, with few-shot prompts sometimes reducing performance. The recommended practice is to describe the problem and specify the desired output format in a zero-shot setting for best results.
  - Software engineering tasks and efficiency: The long evaluation times hinder large-scale RL in software engineering, limiting observed gains over DeepSeek-V3. Future versions will explore rejection sampling on software engineering data and asynchronous evaluations to improve RL efficiency.

- Synthesis and forward-looking stance
  - The section delineates a clear research trajectory: pursue longer CoT and multilingual capabilities to close the general-capability gap; adopt prompting strategies that stabilize zero-shot formulations; and enhance RL efficiency (e.g., rejection sampling, asynchronous evaluation) for long-horizon domains like software engineering.
  - It also implicitly suggests a blended path going forward—leveraging the demonstrated RL gains and the practical, scalable successes of distillation, with future work aiming to integrate these ideas with more capable base models and more resource-efficient training paradigms.

Overall, Section 5 closes the narrative by presenting a balanced view: incentive-based reasoning yields meaningful gains, distillation offers a scalable deployment route, and the path ahead involves expanding capability, multilingual robustness, prompt reliability, and computational efficiency to realize broader, real-world impact. This continues the report’s consistent thread from earlier sections: capitalize on reasoning-enabled improvements while maintaining a pragmatic emphasis on scalable deployment.
