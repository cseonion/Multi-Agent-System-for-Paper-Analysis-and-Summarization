논문 제목: DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning
섹션: 3.1.. DeepSeek-R1 Evaluation
==================================================

Building on the experimental framework established earlier (Section 3 and the distillation-driven pipeline outlined in Section 2), Section 3.1 presents the empirical evaluation of DeepSeek-R1 across a broad, multi-domain benchmark suite to quantify reasoning gains driven by reinforcement learning.

Key aspects of the evaluation framework
- Prompts and protocols: The study uses the DeepSeek-V3 setup for standard benchmarks (MMLU family, GPQA Diamond, SimpleQA, etc.), with zero-shot adaptations for MMLU-Pro, C-Eval, and CLUE-WSC to avoid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) degradation in this model. For open-ended and long-context tasks, the team emphasizes reliability via pass@k and cons@64 metrics, and uses non-zero-temperature sampling (temperature 0.6, top-p 0.95) to generate multiple responses per item.
- Output controls and baselines: Outputs are capped at 32,768 tokens to ensure comparability. Baselines include DeepSeek-V3 and strong competitors (Claude-Sonnet-3.5-1022, GPT-4o-0513, OpenAI-o1-mini, OpenAI-o1-1217), with distilled models (e.g., QwQ-32B-Preview) included for smaller-model comparisons. Maximum generation length is fixed to maintain fairness across models.
- Evaluation scope and sampling: For long-form and reasoning tasks, the approach mitigates length bias via evaluation protocols that emphasize robust pass@1 and consensus-based results (cons@64 where applicable).

Benchmarks and observed strengths
- Education and STEM reasoning: Across MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA Diamond, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3, driven largely by improved accuracy on STEM questions. This aligns with the paper’s thesis that RL incentivizes structured reasoning in technical domains.
- Long-context reasoning: On FRAMES, which requires document-era reasoning over extended contexts, DeepSeek-R1 shows notable gains, indicating enhanced document analysis and sustained reasoning over long inputs.
- Fact-based and generic QA: On SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 generally surpasses DeepSeek-V3, signaling improved handling of fact-oriented queries. However, on Chinese SimpleQA, its performance lags behind DeepSeek-V3 due to safety RL constraints limiting willingness to answer certain queries. The authors note that removing safety RL could push accuracy above ~70% on these tasks, highlighting a trade-off between safety constraints and coverage.
- Open-ended generation and robustness: In open-ended tasks judged by LLMs (AlpacaEval 2.0 and ArenaHard), DeepSeek-R1 delivers more reliable reasoning signals and better alignment with the judging models (e.g., GPT-4-Turbo-1106), aided by the evaluation design that reduces length-bias effects.
- Coding and math benchmarks: In math and algorithmic coding, DeepSeek-R1 shows competitive performance, often on par with or better than baselines on LiveCodeBench (CoT style) and Codeforces problems (Div. 2 rounds with expert test cases). In engineering-oriented coding tasks, OpenAI-o1-1217 can outperform DeepSeek-R1 on Aider but matches on SWE Verified, suggesting room for improvement in engineering-specific data; the authors expect gains with more RL data in future iterations.

Distillation and model scale
- Practical transfer to smaller models: Distilled results demonstrate that supervised fine-tuning on a curated DeepSeek-R1-derived dataset can impart meaningful reasoning capabilities to compact models. This supports the broader claim that strong RL-driven reasoning signals can be propagated across model scales, providing a practical path to extending reasoning capabilities when RL data is limited or when resource constraints apply.

Safety trade-offs and domain considerations
- Safety RL impact: The Chinese SimpleQA decline illustrates a concrete safety trade-off: enforcing safety constraints can reduce coverage in domain-specific QA. The authors suggest that relaxing safety gates could unlock higher accuracy in these domains, underscoring the need to balance safety with capability depending on deployment context.

Connections to the paper’s broader theme
- Reinforcement learning as a general booster of reasoning: The results reinforce the central claim that RL-based incentives improve structured, multi-step reasoning—particularly in STEM and long-context scenarios—and that these gains generalize beyond narrow benchmarks.
- Evaluation design as a robustness pillar: The careful use of zero-shot prompts where appropriate, avoidance of length bias, and a diverse set of benchmarks illustrate the paper’s commitment to robust, scalable measurement of reasoning across model scales and task formats.
- Pipeline synergy: Section 3’s results build directly on Section 2’s distillation narrative, showing how RL-driven reasoning signals translate into broad gains across a heterogeneous benchmark suite, while also clarifying safety-related trade-offs that accompany such gains.

Main takeaways
- DeepSeek-R1 exhibits broad, tangible gains in reasoning capabilities across STEM, long-context, and open-ended tasks, outperforming the prior DeepSeek-V3 baseline in many domains.
- The evaluation framework meticulously controls for length bias and sampling variability, yielding robust pass@1 and cons@64 results that reflect genuine reasoning improvements.
- Safety constraints introduce domain-specific trade-offs, particularly in non-English or safety-sensitive contexts; decisions about safety RL will influence performance in those domains.
- Distillation remains a viable channel for transferring reasoning capabilities to smaller models, supporting scalable deployment whenRL resources or data are limited.

In sum, Section 3.1 substantiates the core thesis that reinforcement-learning–driven reasoning in DeepSeek-R1 yields broad, cross-domain advantages, especially in STEM and long-context tasks, while also exposing the practical and safety-related considerations that accompany such gains. This section reinforces the narrative from Section 2 about the value of RL signals and sets the empirical baseline for subsequent analyses and ablations in the paper.
