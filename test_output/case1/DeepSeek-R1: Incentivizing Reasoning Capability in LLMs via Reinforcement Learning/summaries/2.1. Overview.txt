논문 제목: DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning
섹션: 2.1.. Overview
==================================================

Section 2.1 Overview continues the paper’s central thesis that robust reasoning can be cultivated through reinforcement learning (RL) with minimal or no supervised fine-tuning (SFT) startup, and that this can be further enhanced with a small amount of cold-start data. Building on the prior emphasis that RL can incentivize reasoning patterns, this section introduces the concrete instantiations and the broader pipeline that the rest of the paper investigates.

Key contributions and components introduced in this section:
- DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Apply RL directly to the base model without any SFT data, exploring a pure-RL pathway to acquire reasoning capabilities.
- DeepSeek-R1: Apply RL starting from a checkpoint that has been fine-tuned with thousands of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples, integrating a coarse SFT-like seed to potentially accelerate and stabilize learning.
- Distillation objective: After RL-based reasoning is enhanced in DeepSeek-R1, distill these capabilities into smaller, dense models to enable practical deployment and broader accessibility.

Relation to the paper’s broader theme:
- These variants operationalize the two-stage RL and two-stage SFT narrative: first use RL to discover and strengthen reasoning patterns without heavy SFT reliance, then optionally incorporate CoT-based SFT to further boost performance, and finally distill the gains to compact models.
- The overview frames a cohesive methodology aimed at open-source robustness and practical transferability, setting up the empirical evaluations that compare pure-RL, RL with CoT seeds, and distillation across diverse tasks.

Continuity with prior sections:
- Mirrors the Section 1.2 findings that pure-RL pathways can yield strong reasoning and that staged SFT and distillation can stabilize and broaden capabilities, while extending the discussion to the concrete configurations (Zero vs. CoT-seeded RL) and the downstream distillation objective.
