Here’s a concise synthesis and practical guidance based on the summaries and analysis report.

Executive synthesis
- Attention Is All You Need (Transformer): Introduces a pure-attention encoder–decoder for sequence transduction, enabling high parallelism and strong long-range dependency modeling; foundational architecture for later models.
- BERT: Uses a Transformer encoder to pre-train deep bidirectional language representations via MLM+NSP, then fine-tunes for diverse NLU tasks; establishes the pre-train-then-fine-tune paradigm.
- RoBERTa: Keeps BERT’s architecture but optimizes the pretraining recipe (dynamic masking, no NSP, more data, larger batches, longer training, byte-level BPE), yielding strong gains across NLU benchmarks.

Key comparative insights
- Problem framing: Transformer targets sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., MT); BERT/RoBERTa target general NLU (classification, QA, inference).
- Architecture: Transformer uses encoder–decoder; BERT/RoBERTa use encoder-only.
- Objectives: Transformer trained directly on supervised MT; BERT uses MLM+NSP; RoBERTa uses MLM only with dynamic masking.
- Scaling levers: RoBERTa shows that data scale, longer training, and larger batches can rival architectural changes.
- Shared limitation: Quadratic self-attention cost restricts very long contexts.

Practical guidance
- Model selection
  - Sequence generation/translation or general seq2seq: Start with Transformer (or modern derivatives); incorporate encoder–decoder attention and autoregressive masking.
  - General NLU (classification, QA, inference): Prefer RoBERTa for best out-of-the-box accuracy; BERT-Base remains a solid, lighter baseline when resources are limited.
- Fine-tuning best practices (BERT/RoBERTa)
  - Use task heads minimally (e.g., [CLS] for classification; span heads for QA).
  - Hyperparameters to try first: learning rate 1e-5 to 5e-5, warmup 5–10%, batch size as large as fits, epochs 2–5 with early stopping.
  - Input packing: Use full sentences/document segments when appropriate; ensure correct [SEP]/segment IDs if using BERT.
- Pretraining from scratch (if required)
  - Prefer RoBERTa-style recipe: dynamic masking, no NSP, byte-level BPE, large diverse corpora, large batches, long schedules.
  - Expect substantial compute requirements; scaling up reliably improves performance.
- Efficiency and deployment
  - For constrained environments: choose smaller models (Base), distillation or pruning; limit max sequence length where possible.
  - For longer contexts: consider chunking or local attention variants; vanilla self-attention scales quadratically.

Limitations to keep in mind
- Compute cost: Pretraining BERT/RoBERTa at scale is expensive; even fine-tuning large models can be heavy.
- Long-context handling: None of these core models natively solve long-sequence efficiency.
- Task mismatch: BERT/RoBERTa are not generative; use encoder–decoder or decoder-only models for generation.
