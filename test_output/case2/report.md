Here’s a concise synthesis and practitioner guidance based on your summaries and analysis.

Executive synthesis
- Progression:
  1) Attention Is All You Need (Transformer): Replaces recurrence/convolution with pure attention in an encoder–decoder, unlocking parallelism and SOTA MT.
  2) BERT: Adds large-scale, bidirectional pre-training (MLM+NSP) on a Transformer encoder to create general-purpose language representations for fine-tuning.
  3) RoBERTa: Keeps BERT’s architecture but optimizes the pre-training recipe (more data, longer training, dynamic masking, no NSP), substantially boosting downstream results.

Core differences at a glance
- Architecture:
  - Transformer: Encoder–decoder with multi-head self-attention; designed for sequence transduction (e.g., MT).
  - BERT/RoBERTa: Encoder-only stacks for universal language understanding; no decoder.
- Objectives:
  - Transformer: Supervised translation loss on parallel corpora.
  - BERT: MLM + NSP.
  - RoBERTa: MLM only, dynamic masking; removes NSP.
- Data/scale:
  - Transformer: WMT14 MT corpora.
  - BERT: ~16GB (BooksCorpus + Wikipedia).
  - RoBERTa: ~160GB mixed web/news/story corpora and longer training with large batches.
- Headline results (illustrative):
  - Transformer: WMT14 En–De BLEU ≈ 28.4; En–Fr BLEU ≈ 41.0.
  - BERT LARGE: GLUE ≈ 80.5 avg; SQuAD v1.1 F1 ≈ 93.2; v2.0 F1 ≈ 83.1.
  - RoBERTa LARGE: GLUE ≈ 88.5 avg; SQuAD v1.1 F1 ≈ 94.6; v2.0 F1 ≈ 86.4; strong RACE.

What to use when
- Machine translation and other sequence-to-sequence tasks: Start with the Transformer (encoder–decoder) or its modern seq2seq descendants. BERT/RoBERTa are not generative decoders.
- General NLP understanding (classification, QA, NLI, NER): Prefer RoBERTa over BERT as a drop-in encoder for better performance; BERT remains a strong baseline when compute/data are tighter.
- Feature extraction vs fine-tuning: Fine-tuning typically wins; feature-based extraction from top layers is viable when labeled data or compute for end-to-end tuning is limited.

Practical guidance
- If starting from scratch on understanding tasks:
  - Choose RoBERTa BASE for a strong speed/quality trade-off; LARGE if you have compute and want top accuracy.
  - Use dynamic masking (built into RoBERTa pretraining) and omit NSP if you pre-train further.
- Domain adaptation:
  - Further pre-train (continued MLM) on in-domain unlabeled text before fine-tuning (DAPT) when your target domain diverges from general English.
- Data and batching:
  - Larger and more diverse pretraining data improves transfer; long training with large effective batch sizes is beneficial if resources allow.
- Sequence length and memory:
  - All use full self-attention with quadratic cost; for long documents consider chunking, retrieval-augmented setups, or specialized long-attention variants.
- Regularization/optimization:
  - Warmup schedules with Adam, dropout, and label smoothing (for seq2seq) matter; for fine-tuning, tune LR, batch size, and epochs per task.

Limitations to plan around
- Quadratic attention cost limits very long inputs.
- Significant compute and data needs for pretraining at RoBERTa scale.
- Original pretraining is English-centric; multilingual or specialized domains require adaptation.

Impact in one line each
- Transformer: Proved attention alone can replace recurrence/convolution for seq2seq with superior parallelism and SOTA MT.
- BERT: Established bidirectional MLM pretraining as the default path to transferable language understanding.
- RoBERTa: Showed the pretraining recipe—data, duration, masking, and batch size—drives large gains without architectural changes.
