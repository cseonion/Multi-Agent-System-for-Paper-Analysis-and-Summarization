섹션 1: Introduction
----------------------------------------
I don’t see any section text to summarize. Please paste the raw text of the current section you want summarized, and if available include the summary of the previous sections. I will provide a concise, paragraph-form summary that preserves all numerical details, without bullet points. If you want to start from Section 1, send Section 1’s text. You can also specify any length constraints, but I’ll aim to minimize length while keeping key numbers intact.

섹션 2: Background
----------------------------------------
This section briefly outlines the BERT pretraining approach introduced by Devlin et al. (2019) and describes several training choices that will be empirically examined in the following section.

섹션 2.1: Setup
----------------------------------------
BERT's Setup section states that input is a single sequence formed by concatenating two token segments, x1…xN and y1…yM, which typically contain multiple sentences. These segments are separated by special tokens, and their combined length must satisfy M + N < T, where T is the maximum sequence length used during training. The model is first pretrained on a large unlabeled text corpus and subsequently finetuned on labeled data for the end task.

섹션 2.2: Architecture
----------------------------------------
BERT adopts the standard transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), which is not described in detail here. It uses a transformer with L layers, and each block contains A self-attention heads and a hidden dimension H.

섹션 2.3: Training Objectives
----------------------------------------
During pretraining, BERT uses two objectives: masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP). For MLM, a random subset of input tokens is selected and replaced with the [MASK] token, with the objective being a cross-entropy loss over the predicted tokens. Specifically, 15% of input tokens are chosen for possible replacement; of these, 80% are replaced with [MASK], 10% are left unchanged, and 10% are replaced by a randomly selected vocabulary token. In the original implementation, masking and replacement are decided once at the beginning and saved for the training duration, though in practice data are duplicated so the mask is not fixed for every training sentence (see Section 4.1). The NSP objective is designed to improve performance on downstream tasks requiring reasoning about relationships between pairs of sentences, such as natural language inference.

섹션 2.4: Optimization
----------------------------------------
Optimization is performed with Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015) using β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999, ε = 1e-6 and an L2 weight decay of 0.01. The learning rate warms up over the first 10,000 steps to a peak of 1e-4 and then decays linearly. Training uses dropout of 0.1 on all layers and attention weights, and a GELU activation function. Pretraining runs for S = 1,000,000 updates, with minibatches of B = 256 sequences of maximum length T = 512 tokens.

섹션 2.5: Data
----------------------------------------
BERT is trained on a combination of BookCorpus (Zhu et al., 2015) and English Wikipedia, totaling 16GB of uncompressed text.

섹션 3: Experimental Setup
----------------------------------------
This section explains the experimental setup used to carry out the authors’ replication study of BERT.

섹션 3.1: Implementation
----------------------------------------
The authors reimplement BERT in FAIRSEQ and largely adhere to the original BERT optimization hyperparameters from Section 2, except that the peak learning rate and the number of warmup steps are tuned separately for each setting. They find that the Adam epsilon term is highly sensitive, and tuning it can yield better performance or stability, and that setting beta2 to 0.98 improves stability when training with large batches. Pretraining uses sequences of up to T = 512 tokens (i.e., 512-token maximum). Unlike Devlin et al. (2019), they do not inject short sequences randomly and do not train with a reduced sequence length for the first 90% of updates; training is conducted only with full-length sequences. Training runs use mixed-precision arithmetic on DGX-1 machines, each equipped with 8 × 32 GB Nvidia V100 GPUs connected by Infiniband (Micikevicius et al., 2018).

섹션 3.2: Data
----------------------------------------
Section 3.2 emphasizes that BERT-style pretraining requires large-scale text and that more data can improve downstream performance, noting that many large datasets are not publicly released. To maximize experimentation, the authors focus on gathering as much data as possible to match the overall quality and quantity needed for fair comparisons. They consider five English-language corpora totaling over 160 GB of uncompressed text, namely BOOKCORPUS plus English Wikipedia (16 GB; the original data used to train BERT), CC-NEWS from the English portion of CommonCrawl News (63 million English articles, 76 GB after filtering, collected between September 2016 and February 2019), OPENWEBTEXT (38 GB), an open-source recreation of WebText consisting of web content from Reddit links with at least three upvotes, and STORIES (31 GB), a subset of CommonCrawl filtered to resemble story-like Winograd schemas; together these amount to approximately 161 GB.

섹션 3.3: Evaluation
----------------------------------------
This evaluation section assesses pretrained models on three downstream benchmarks: GLUE, SQuAD, and RACE. GLUE aggregates nine datasets for natural language understanding, with six tasks framed as either single-sentence or sentence-pair classifications; GLUE provides train and development splits plus a submission server and leaderboard for private held-out test data. For the replication study in Section 4, results are reported on development sets after finetuning the pretrained models on the corresponding single-task training data, without multi-task training or ensembling, following the finetuning procedure of the original BERT paper (Devlin et al., 2019). In Section 5, test-set results obtained from the public leaderboard are also reported, with several task-specific modifications described in Section 5.1. SQuAD comprises a paragraph of context and a question; there are two versions: V1.1 and V2.0, with V2.0 introducing unanswerable questions. For SQuAD V1.1, the same span-prediction method as BERT is used; for V2.0, an additional binary classifier predicts answerability and is trained jointly by summing the classification and span losses, with evaluation only on spans for questions classified as answerable. RACE is a large-scale reading-comprehension dataset from English examinations in China, containing more than 28,000 passages and nearly 100,000 questions; each question has four options, and passages have significantly longer context with substantial reasoning requirements.

섹션 4: Training Procedure Analysis
----------------------------------------
This section investigates which factors influence successful pretraining of BERT models while keeping the architecture fixed. Specifically, the authors begin by training BERT models with the BERT BASE configuration: 12 layers (L = 12), hidden size 768 (H = 768), 12 attention heads (A = 12), totaling 110 million parameters.

섹션 4.1: Static vs. Dynamic Masking
----------------------------------------
Section 4.1 investigates static versus dynamic masking. The original BERT used a single static mask created during preprocessing; to avoid reusing the same mask across epochs, the authors duplicated the training data 10 times so each sequence is masked in 10 different ways over 40 training epochs, meaning each sequence is seen with the same mask four times. They compare this with dynamic masking, where the masking pattern is regenerated each time a sequence is fed to the model, a strategy that becomes important for longer pretraining. Table 1 reports SQuAD 2.0 F1, MNLI-m and SST-2 accuracy, with reference results from Devlin et al. (2019) of 76.3, 84.3 and 92.8, respectively. The reimplementation with static masking achieves 78.3 (SQuAD), 84.3 (MNLI-m), and 92.5 (SST-2), while dynamic masking achieves 78.7, 84.0, and 92.9, respectively; results are medians over five seeds. The authors find that static masking reproduces the original BERT results closely, and dynamic masking is comparable or slightly better. Given the efficiency benefits of dynamic masking, they adopt it for the remaining experiments.

섹션 4.2: Model Input Format and Next Sentence Prediction
----------------------------------------
Section 4.2 examines how the pretraining input format and the Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) objective affect performance. The original BERT uses a SEGMENT-PAIR input with NSP, where the two segments can come from the same document contiguously (p = 0.5) or from different documents. Four training formats are compared: SEGMENT-PAIR+NSP; SENTENCE-PAIR+NSP, which uses pairs of natural sentences (shorter than 512 tokens; the batch is enlarged to keep the total token count similar to SEGMENT-PAIR+NSP); FULL-SENTENCES, where inputs are packed with full sentences from one or more documents (total length ≤ 512, can cross document boundaries) and NSP is removed; and DOC-SENTENCES, similar to FULL-SENTENCES but restricted to a single document (may not cross boundaries), with dynamically increased batch sizes when sequences near the end of a document are shorter to match the total tokens of FULL-SENTENCES, and NSP removed. Table 2 shows that SEGMENT-PAIR and SENTENCE-PAIR differ in performance, with the latter harming downstream tasks, likely due to reduced long-range dependency learning. Training without NSP and using DOC-SENTENCES outperforms the original BERT BASE and, in some cases, matches or slightly improves downstream tasks, suggesting the original results may have effectively removed NSP while retaining the SEGMENT-PAIR input. Among single-document formats, DOC-SENTENCES is marginally better than FULL-SENTENCES; however, DOC-SENTENCES yields variable batch sizes, so for easier cross-study comparison the authors adopt FULL-SENTENCES in subsequent experiments.

섹션 4.3: Training with large batches
----------------------------------------
Training with very large mini-batches, a strategy well established in neural machine translation, is shown to accelerate optimization and improve end-task performance for BERT when the learning rate is scaled appropriately. Devlin et al. originally trained BERT BASE for 1M steps with a batch size of 256 sequences, which is computationally equivalent (via gradient accumulation) to 125K steps with a 2K batch or 31K steps with an 8K batch. In Table 3, base models trained on BOOKCORPUS and Wikipedia with batch sizes of 256, 2K, and 8K sequences—corresponding to 1M, 125K, and 31K steps and learning rates of 1e-4, 7e-4, and 1e-3, respectively—achieve perplexities of 3.99, 3.68, and 3.77 and development accuracies of 84.7/92.7, 85.2/92.9, and 84.6/92.8 on MNLI-m and SST-2, with the same number of passes and overall computational cost. The results indicate that larger batches improve both masked language modeling perplexity and end-task accuracy, and larger batches ease parallelization via distributed data parallel training, with experiments extending to 8K-sequence batches; You et al. push even larger up to 32K. The authors note that exploring the ultimate limits of large-batch training is left for future work.

섹션 4.4: Text Encoding
----------------------------------------
Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) is used to manage large vocabularies by forming subword units that bridge character- and word-level representations. BPE vocabularies typically span 10K–100K, but Radford et al. (2019) show that using bytes as the base subword units yields a 50K-subword vocabulary that can encode any input without unknown tokens, adding about 15M parameters to BERT-Base and 20M to BERT-Large. The original BERT used a 30K character-level BPE after heuristic tokenization; here a universal byte-level BPE is adopted without extra preprocessing, with only minor differences in end-task performance in early experiments, though the universal encoding is favored and a detailed comparison is deferred to future work. Large-batch training can improve efficiency even without extensive parallel hardware via gradient accumulation, a capability supported natively in FAIRSEQ (Ott et al., 2019).

섹션 5: RoBERTa
----------------------------------------
RoBERTa consolidates the improvements explored earlier into a single configuration named RoBERTa for Robustly optimized BERT approach. It combines dynamic masking (Section 4.1), FULL-SENTENCES training without NSP loss (Section 4.2), large mini-batches (Section 4.3), and a larger byte-level BPE (Section 4.4), and it also investigates two factors often overlooked: the amount and diversity of pretraining data and the number of training passes through the data. To contextualize the gains, the section contrasts with XLNet, which trains on roughly ten times more data and eight times larger batches for fewer optimization steps, yielding roughly four times as many pretraining sequences as BERT. The authors first train RoBERTa in the BERT LARGE style (L = 24, H = 1024, A = 16, 355M parameters) for 100K steps on a comparable BOOK-CORPUS plus Wikipedia dataset, using 1024 V100 GPUs for about one day, and report results in Table 4, noting that RoBERTa substantially improves over the original BERT LARGE when data is controlled. Next, they combine this data with three additional datasets from Section 3.2 and pretrain RoBERTa over the same 100K-step schedule on a total of 160GB of text, observing further improvements across downstream tasks and underscoring the importance of data size and diversity. Finally, they extend pretraining to 300K and then 500K steps, obtaining significant gains and finding that the 300K and 500K-step models outperform XLNet LARGE on most tasks, with no overfitting observed even at the longest training, suggesting potential benefits from even more training. The remaining analysis evaluates the best RoBERTa model on GLUE, SQuaD, and RACE, while noting that the experiments conflate increases in data size and diversity and reserving a more careful analysis for future work. They conclude with RoBERTa being trained for 500K steps over all five datasets introduced in Section 3.2.

섹션 5.1: GLUE Results
----------------------------------------
In the GLUE results, RoBERTa is evaluated under two finetuning settings. In the first setting, the single-task, dev setup, RoBERTa is finetuned separately for each GLUE task using only the task’s training data, with a limited hyperparameter sweep over batch sizes {16, 32} and learning rates {1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5}, a linear warmup for the first 6% of steps followed by a linear decay to 0, and finetuning for 10 epochs with early stopping based on the task’s dev metric; all other hyperparameters mirror pretraining, and results are reported as medians over five random initializations without ensembling. In the second setting, ensembles, test, RoBERTa is submitted to the GLUE leaderboard based on single-task finetuning; for RTE, STS, and MRPC they fine-tune from the MNLI single-task model rather than the baseline RoBERTa, and they explore a wider hyperparameter space with ensembles of 5 to 7 models per task. Task-specific modifications include QNLI, which adopts a pairwise ranking approach for the test submission while providing dev results for a pure classification baseline for comparability; and WNLI, reformatted via Super-GLUE, trained with a margin ranking loss using spaCy-extracted noun phrases so that positive referents score higher, though this uses only positive training examples. Table 5 shows that in the single-task setting RoBERTa achieves state-of-the-art results on all nine GLUE development sets, outperforming both BERT LARGE and XLNet LARGE despite using the same masked language modeling objective and architecture, underscoring the influence of data size and training time. In the ensemble setting, RoBERTa attains state-of-the-art on four of nine tasks and the highest average score to date, notably without multi-task finetuning, suggesting future gains from more sophisticated multitask fine-tuning.

섹션 5.2: SQuAD Results
----------------------------------------
We adopt a simpler approach for SQuAD than in prior work, using the same learning rate for all layers as a shared setting. For SQuAD v1.1 we follow the finetuning procedure of Devlin et al. (2019); for SQuAD v2.0 we additionally classify whether a question is answerable and train this classifier jointly with the span predictor by summing their loss terms. Results are reported in Table 6: on SQuAD v1.1 development, RoBERTa matches the state-of-the-art set by XLNet, and on SQuAD v2.0 development, RoBERTa sets a new state-of-the-art, improving XLNet by 0.4 EM and 0.6 F1. We also submitted RoBERTa to the public SQuAD 2.0 leaderboard, comparing to other systems; most top systems build on either BERT or XLNet, both of which rely on additional external training data, whereas our submission uses no extra data. Our single RoBERTa model outperforms all but one of the single-model submissions and is the top scoring system among those that do not rely on data augmentation.

섹션 5.3: RACE Results
----------------------------------------
In RACE, where a passage, a question, and four candidate answers are provided, the model must select the correct option. The RoBERTa adaptation concatenates each candidate answer with the corresponding question and passage, encodes each of the four resulting sequences, and uses the [CLS] representations passed through a single fully-connected layer to predict the correct answer. They truncate any question–answer pair longer than 128 tokens, and, if needed, shorten the passage so that the total length does not exceed 512 tokens. Results on the RACE test sets (Table 7) show that RoBERTa achieves state-of-the-art performance on both middle-school and high-school settings.

섹션 6: Related Work
----------------------------------------
Pretraining methods have pursued a range of objectives, including language modeling, machine translation, and masked language modeling, with many works following the standard recipe of finetuning models for each task and pretraining with a masked LM objective. Yet progress has also come from multi-task fine-tuning, incorporating entity embeddings, span prediction, and autoregressive pretraining variants, with performance typically improving as models grow larger and are trained on more data. The authors’ aim is to replicate, simplify, and better tune BERT’s training to understand the relative performance of these methods. They systematically evaluate design decisions in pretraining BERT and find that substantial gains come from longer training with bigger batches over more data, removing the next sentence prediction objective, training on longer sequences, and dynamically varying the masking pattern. Their RoBERTa pretraining procedure achieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE, and SQuAD without multi-task fine-tuning for GLUE or additional data for SQuAD, illustrating the importance of these design choices and suggesting that BERT’s pretraining objective remains competitive with newer alternatives.
