'BERT' is accurately placed under Computer Science with sub-fields Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence, consistent with its description as a bidirectional Transformer model for language understanding. 'RoBERTa' is similarly categorized under Computer Science with relevant sub-fields including Transformers, reflecting its nature as an optimized BERT variant.
