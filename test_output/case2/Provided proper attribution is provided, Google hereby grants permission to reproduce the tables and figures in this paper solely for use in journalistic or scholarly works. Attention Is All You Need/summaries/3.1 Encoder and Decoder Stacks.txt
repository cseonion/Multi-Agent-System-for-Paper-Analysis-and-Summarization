The encoder and decoder both use stacks of six identical layers (N = 6). Each encoder layer contains two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a positionwise fully connected feed-forward network, with residual connections around each sub-layer followed by layer normalization, implemented as LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)). All sub-layers and the embedding layers produce outputs of dimension d_model = 512. The decoder mirrors this structure but adds a third sub-layer per layer that performs multi-head attention over the encoder stack (encoder-decoder attention). Like the encoder, the decoder uses residual connections and layer normalization around each sub-layer. Additionally, the decoderâ€™s self-attention is masked to prevent attending to subsequent positions, and the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensuring that position i can depend only on known outputs at positions less than i.
