- Section 3.2 defines attention as a function that maps a query and a set of key-value pairs (all vectors) to an output vector.
- The output is produced as a weighted sum of the values, where the weights are determined by a compatibility function between the query and each key.
- The section specifically mentions Scaled Dot-Product Attention and Multi-Head Attention as the mechanisms for computing these outputs.
