Section summary: Input-Input Layer5

This section presents a visualization of the input-to-input self-attention at layer 5. It highlights attention patterns for heads 5 and 6, with a focus on the word "its" in the example sentence "The Law will never be perfect, but its application should be just this is what we are missing, in my opinion." The authors note that the attentions around the word "its" are very sharp, suggesting that these heads specialize in focusing on this token within the input sequence. (Formatting noise in the text repeats the sentence and mentions “isolated attentions” for the word 'its', but the core point is the sharp attention on that token.)
