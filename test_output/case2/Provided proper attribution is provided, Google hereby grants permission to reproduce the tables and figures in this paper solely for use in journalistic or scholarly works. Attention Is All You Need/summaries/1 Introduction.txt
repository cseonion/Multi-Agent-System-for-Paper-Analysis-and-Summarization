I’m ready to summarize, but I need the raw text of Section 1 and, if available, the summary of any previous sections (there are none for the first section). Please paste Section 1 in full. If the paper is divided into multiple sections, you can provide them in order after I return Section 1’s summary. I will produce a concise, single-paragraph summary that preserves all key numerical details and results, with no bullet points. If there are important numbers in figures or tables, you can include their values or references to them so I can preserve them accurately.
