There is evidence that transferring from supervised tasks trained on large datasets yields strong results, notably natural language inference (Conneau et al., 2017) and machine translation (McCann et al., 2017). In computer vision, transfer learning is likewise effective, with a common recipe of fine-tuning models pre-trained on ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009; Yosinski et al., 2014).
