Tassi et al. tested two conditions—Baseline (no nap, no noise; no nap, noise) and Experimental (nap, no noise; nap, noise)—across two nights in a counterbalanced design to assess the effects of a 5000 Hz pink noise signal delivered at 75 dB on spatial memory after awakening from 1-hour naps placed at 00:00 h and 03:00 h. When noise was presented, reaction time at 01:00 h showed no difference between Baseline and Experimental. Without noise, performance was inferior for up to 15 minutes in the Experimental (nap) condition compared with Baseline (no nap). These findings suggest pink noise may improve performance by reducing sleep inertia after awakening, but in a later test session pink noise was ineffective and could potentially exacerbate performance decrement. The conflicting results between test epochs are attributed to sleep stages at awakening, and the authors acknowledge that no firm conclusion can be drawn at this preliminary stage, calling for further research.
