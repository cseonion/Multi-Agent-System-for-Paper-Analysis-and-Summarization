Music interventions for counteracting sleep inertia (SI) are reviewed through two lines of inquiry. Hayashi et al. studied a 20-minute daytime nap at 14:00 h, where the Experimental group was awakened with either a high- or low-preference 60 dB stimulus, with high preference described as ‘popular music’ by participants and low preference as an ‘excitative’ piece (Mars from The Planets by Holst). The Control group was awakened by an intercom. After awakening, the Experimental group completed a visual oddball task (the Control group performed a memory search task) and both groups reported subjective sleepiness and comfort. The high-preference condition yielded better RT performance than the low-preference condition, although correct-response counts did not differ. Subjective sleepiness post-nap was reduced in the high-preference condition versus the intercom and low-preference, while low-preference did not differ from Control. Subjective comfort was highest in the high-preference condition compared with Control or low-preference. Taken together, these results imply that preferred music may attenuate SI in terms of RT and subjective sleepiness, although the lack of detailed musical characteristics and absence of analyses comparing music to intercom limit interpretability.

McFarlane et al. (two studies, 2020) extended this work ecologically with day-to-day awakening sounds tested remotely. In Study 83, an online questionnaire sought bottom-up insights into which sounds or music might mitigate SI and the attributes that contribute, finding no significant link between SI and waking-sound type or liking, though a melodic sound related to reduced SI on an adapted Sleep Inertia Questionnaire, whereas a neutral sound related to increased SI; melodic sounds also tended to be rated more rhythmic. Study 84 then used custom melodic and rhythmic stimuli in habitual environments (all stimuli shared at 105 BPM, 4/4, in the key of C with woodblock and vibraphone timbres). In two sessions, participants first faced a Control, then—depending on the group—a Melodic or Rhythmic treatment. The melodic treatment significantly reduced attentional lapses and false starts and yielded a higher PVT score than Control, though RT and response speed did not differ. The Rhythmic treatment showed no significant effects. These findings support melodic content as a potential driver in counteracting SI in ecological settings, while rhythmic stimuli alone did not produce improvements.
