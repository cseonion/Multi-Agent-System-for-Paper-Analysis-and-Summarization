This section synthesizes findings from twelve studies retrieved from ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus and via Google Scholar, screened as shown in Figure 1, and grouped into three stimulus themes—Noise (58), Emergency alarms; Tone sequences, voice and hybrids (77–82), and Music (57, 83, 84) (Table 1)—across emergency (58, 77–86) and non-emergency awakenings (57, 83, 84) in laboratory and field settings. Sample sizes ranged from n = 14 to n = 188. Emergency-awakening research predominantly involved children, whereas non-emergency studies involved adults. In children, evidence favors a low-frequency T-3 signal (500 Hz square wave) and voice notifications over high-pitched alarms for awakening and post-awakening performance; a low-frequency alarm is more effective than a maternal alarm and than an actor’s voice in post-awakening performance, though there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about sleep inertia (SI) per se, making the T-3/voice design appear superior to higher-frequency (~2000–4000 Hz) pulsed or sequenced alarms. In adults, initial findings are limited: a high-frequency pulse alarm (2000–4000 Hz at ~60 dB) can awaken and reduce SI regardless of sleep stage, but lacks control or comparator conditions akin to the child studies, so the best option remains unresolved. Pink noise (5000 Hz, 75 dB) may enhance performance after early-night awakenings but not later ones, with insufficient evidence to generalize to children or adults. Across groups, no significant demographic differences in post-awakening RT to high-frequency alarms are detected, though data are limited and underpowered. Music appears beneficial for non-emergency awakenings in adults, with greater SI reductions when the waking cue is perceived as melodic or preferred by the listener; melodies and popular music enhance RT and sustained attention, whereas neutral and rhythmic stimuli are less effective.
