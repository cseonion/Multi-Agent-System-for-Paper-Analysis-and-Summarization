In this section, the authors state that due to observed inconsistencies across studies after full-text screening and the overall paucity of research in this field, formal bias assessment using standard tools such as the Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a Variety of Fields [75] was not deemed beneficial (noting the noted limitations may render key results inapplicable). Instead, they qualitatively address study limitations and potential bias within the discussion to provide a framework for future research, and they suggest that the structuring of their methods may help reduce bias in subsequent work.
