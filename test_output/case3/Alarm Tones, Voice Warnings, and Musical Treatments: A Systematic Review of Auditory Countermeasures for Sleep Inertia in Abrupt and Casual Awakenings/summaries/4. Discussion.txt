The authors used PRISMA systematic-review guidelines to identify peer-reviewed, English-language research assessing how auditory stimulation may influence sleep inertia (SI) upon and after awakening. This process identified twelve studies that met the criteria (Figure 1), and thorough examination of these studies yielded information on the range of auditory stimuli investigated and their potential efficacy. The ensuing summary aims to highlight gaps and outline directions for future research to strengthen the evidence base on how different auditory treatments may influence SI.
