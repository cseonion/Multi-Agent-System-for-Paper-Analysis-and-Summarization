I’m ready to summarize. Please provide the raw text of Section 1 (the first section) of the paper. If there are any specific formatting or length constraints, or if you want me to incorporate any particular figures or equations, include those details. Once I have Section 1, I will produce a single-paragraph summary preserving all key points and numerical details, and I’ll proceed to summarize subsequent sections sequentially using the earlier summaries as context.
