Eligibility criteria required original research analyzing sleep inertia after awakening to auditory stimuli, either objectively or subjectively. Studies across laboratory, field, and mixed-methods designs using EEG- or non-EEG-confirmed awakenings were eligible. There were no restrictions on the type of auditory stimuli or on participant age, sex, or gender. Articles had to be published in English, report healthy unimpaired human experimental results, and appear in peer-reviewed or refereed journals. All publication dates were accepted, and qualitative analyses and reviews were excluded.
