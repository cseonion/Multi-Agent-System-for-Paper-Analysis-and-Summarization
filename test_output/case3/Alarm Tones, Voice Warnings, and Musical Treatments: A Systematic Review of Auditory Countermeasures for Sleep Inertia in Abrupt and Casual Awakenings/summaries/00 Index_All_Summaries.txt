섹션 1.: Introduction
----------------------------------------
I’m ready to summarize. Please provide the raw text of Section 1 (the first section) of the paper. If there are any specific formatting or length constraints, or if you want me to incorporate any particular figures or equations, include those details. Once I have Section 1, I will produce a single-paragraph summary preserving all key points and numerical details, and I’ll proceed to summarize subsequent sections sequentially using the earlier summaries as context.

섹션 2.: Methods
----------------------------------------
This Methods section states that the authors (SJM, AGD) applied the PRISMA statement guidelines where applicable, as detailed in Table S1, and that an a priori search strategy was developed in accordance with PRISMA-P guidelines (Item No. 10).

섹션 2.1.: Eligibility Criteria
----------------------------------------
Eligibility criteria required original research analyzing sleep inertia after awakening to auditory stimuli, either objectively or subjectively. Studies across laboratory, field, and mixed-methods designs using EEG- or non-EEG-confirmed awakenings were eligible. There were no restrictions on the type of auditory stimuli or on participant age, sex, or gender. Articles had to be published in English, report healthy unimpaired human experimental results, and appear in peer-reviewed or refereed journals. All publication dates were accepted, and qualitative analyses and reviews were excluded.

섹션 2.2.: Information Sources, Search Strategy and Study Selection
----------------------------------------
The information sources and study selection process relied on three electronic databases—ProQuest, PubMed, and Scopus—searched on 15 March 2020 for the term "Sleep Inertia" combined with alarm-related terms (including "Sound," "Noise," "Music," "Alarm," "Alarm Tone," "Alarm Sound," "Alarm Noise," "Alarm Music," "Alarm Clock," "Fire Alarm," and "Smoke Alarm"), yielding 341 records. After removing 140 duplicates, 201 records remained for screening, of which 187 were excluded based on title, abstract, and methodological criteria. Fourteen articles underwent full-text assessment, and 9 were excluded for not meeting inclusion criteria; one article was excluded due to unrelated procedures that could confound results, with authors noting the insignificant findings. This left five articles for which reference lists were screened, identifying one additional study for inclusion. To ensure no relevant literature was missed, the lead authors’ publication records for the six included articles were also examined via Google Scholar on 21 May 2020, chosen for its comprehensiveness despite potential imprecision. After removing duplicates from this secondary search, six more articles meeting the criteria were found, bringing the total number of articles for review to twelve. See Figure 1 for the screening flow diagram.

섹션 2.3.: Data Collection Process and Data Items
----------------------------------------
Data were extracted from each included article using standardized forms to capture study-level attributes essential to the review. The variables recorded included Author, Number of participants (n), Age, Sex or Gender, Setting, Study design, Sleep duration, Awakening time, Stimulus, Decibel (dB), EEG-confirmed awakening (Yes/No), Objective measure, and Subjective measure, with binary items denoted by Yes/No and other factors reported as stated in the original studies. See Table 1 for a summary of the articles. Abbreviations used include NR (Not reported); KSS (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale); PVT (Psychomotor Vigilance Test); S4S (Sleep Stage 4); T-3 (Temporal three smoke alarm); dB (Decibel); S1, S2, S3 (Study No).

섹션 2.4.: Analysis of Bias
----------------------------------------
In this section, the authors state that due to observed inconsistencies across studies after full-text screening and the overall paucity of research in this field, formal bias assessment using standard tools such as the Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a Variety of Fields [75] was not deemed beneficial (noting the noted limitations may render key results inapplicable). Instead, they qualitatively address study limitations and potential bias within the discussion to provide a framework for future research, and they suggest that the structuring of their methods may help reduce bias in subsequent work.

섹션 2.5.: Data Synthesis
----------------------------------------
Section 2.5 Data Synthesis explains that the authors adopted a structured narrative synthesis, agreed between researchers SJM and AGD, to accommodate findings from studies with diverse features such as study design, methodologies, samples, and measures. Through full-text familiarization of each included article and the data extraction process, they generated key research themes to guide the analytical narrative and ensure the full scope of the data is captured.

섹션 3.: Results
----------------------------------------
Section 3 reports that twelve studies met the inclusion criteria for this qualitative synthesis. The included research was conducted in the United States (n=5), Australia (n=5), France (n=1), and Japan (n=1), with publication dates ranging from 1992 to 2020, and five articles published in 2019–2020, indicating growing interest. Most ineligible studies did not directly analyze sound effects on symptoms of SI after awakening, were qualitative, or were not original research. Test stimuli varied: eight studies examined sound in an emergency awakening context using domestic fire alarms, human voice, or hybrids; three studied music; and one tested noise. Alternate stimuli included an intercom (n=1), multimodal conditions combining sound and vibration (n=1), and voice plus alarm (n=1). Ten studies reported stimulus loudness in decibels, with readings roughly between 60 dB and 100 dB. The objective and subjective measures used differed markedly, with all but one study employing objective measures and six not recording subjective measurements. For synthesis, three primary themes were identified: Noise; Emergency tone sequences and Voice alarms and hybrids; and Music.

섹션 3.1.: Noise
----------------------------------------
Tassi et al. tested two conditions—Baseline (no nap, no noise; no nap, noise) and Experimental (nap, no noise; nap, noise)—across two nights in a counterbalanced design to assess the effects of a 5000 Hz pink noise signal delivered at 75 dB on spatial memory after awakening from 1-hour naps placed at 00:00 h and 03:00 h. When noise was presented, reaction time at 01:00 h showed no difference between Baseline and Experimental. Without noise, performance was inferior for up to 15 minutes in the Experimental (nap) condition compared with Baseline (no nap). These findings suggest pink noise may improve performance by reducing sleep inertia after awakening, but in a later test session pink noise was ineffective and could potentially exacerbate performance decrement. The conflicting results between test epochs are attributed to sleep stages at awakening, and the authors acknowledge that no firm conclusion can be drawn at this preliminary stage, calling for further research.

섹션 3.2.: Emergency Alarms; Tone Sequences, Voice and Hybrids
----------------------------------------
Several studies examined how fire alarms affect human performance after abrupt awakenings in pseudo-emergency scenarios. Across these investigations, a variety of experimental designs and stimulus comparisons were employed, with a clear emphasis on age demographics, specifically children/minors (6–17 years) and adults (18+ years).

섹션 3.2.1.: Children
----------------------------------------
The opening child-focused study by Bruck (1999) examined 6–17 year-olds (mean 11.6) and included 36 subjects (22 children) tested in a four-night residential protocol with 60 dB alarms applied between 01:00 and 04:30 h; awakenings were assessed alongside parental controls. Findings showed that 85% of children slept through one or both alarms, while 100% of adults awakened to both; about 95% of all participants woke within 32 seconds of alarm onset. Subjective sleepiness and clarity (SI) did not differ between groups, with both ages reporting an average rating of moderately clear-headed and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) values indicating neither sleepy nor alert across test points. This work thus suggests a 60 dB alarm is less effective at waking children than adults, though successful awakenings were similar across groups with no significant SI differences.

Subsequent work by Bruck and Reid compared three field studies differing by alarm type: a mother’s voice plus an actor’s voice (Study 1, ~315 Hz–2500 Hz), a low-pitch temporal-T3 signal (500 Hz; Study 2), and a high-pitch Australian standard (~4000 Hz; Study 3), all around 89 dB, tested at about 01:00 h (and 03:00 h for some). Across studies, awakenings were significantly poorer with the Australian standard than with voice or low-pitch signals, and arousal sleep latency was longer for the standard. Ratings of clear-headedness showed no significant difference between alarm types, and mean KSS values hovered around 2–3 (sleepy but not deeply sleepy; neither sleepy nor alert). Overall, high-pitched signals were less effective for arousal than mixed low-frequency sequences, though all stimuli yielded some reduction in SI, with only moderate effects on sleepiness.

Building on this, Smith, Splaingard, and colleagues conducted a series of lab-based experiments using 100 dB parent-voice alarms against high-pitched T-3 tones (~3200–4000 Hz) to prompt awakening and self-rescue. In the first study, the parent voice outperformed the high-pitch alarm in awakening and in completing the escape within 5 minutes and within 3 minutes post-awakening. The second study added a hybrid alarm (T-3 plus pillow vibration); RTs were slower than baseline for all conditions, but the hybrid produced faster RTs than either parent voice or tone alone, with no difference between parent voice and tone. In later work, three Smith et al. studies repeatedly tested maternal-voice signals against T-3 tones at 85 dB, revealing that a high-pitch T-3 alarm was consistently less effective for awakening and self-rescue than the broader range of alarms tested. Within studies, there were no significant differences among the maternal voice variants (Name only, Instructions only, or Name plus Instructions) or between male vs female voices or a hybrid variant; however, a low-frequency T-3 signal (500 Hz) improved awakening time versus maternal voice and, compared with an actor’s voice, improved awakening time though not escaping. Across these studies, no significant dissociations emerged between awakening and escaping for the mother or stranger voice treatments.

Overall, across the child-focused work, SI symptoms are heightened when awakening to high-frequency alarms relative to voice or low-frequency alarms, with maternal or actor voices and low-frequency alarms showing comparable effectiveness in mitigating SI. Yet the literature requires larger, adequately powered trials to definitively parse interaction effects among the multiple alarm parameters.

섹션 3.2.2.: Adults
----------------------------------------
In this adult-focused study, Bruck and Horasan examined the awakening efficacy of a high-frequency pulse smoke alarm (2000–4000 Hz, ~60 dB) under naive and non-naive conditions. Participants were assigned to three sleep-stage groups (Stage 4, Stage 2, or REM), with the alarm sounding twice—first naive, then non-naive—triggered upon returning to the assigned sleep stage. After each awakening, they completed subjective sleep quality and sleep quantity measures and performed a computer-based reaction time task. The findings showed no significant differences in the time to reach full wakefulness between naive and non-naive awakenings across sleep stages, and no significant decline in RT performance post-awakening relative to pre-sleep and post-mower/shower control measures. Regarding sleep inertia (SI), the high-frequency pulse alarm was as effective at awakening and in reducing SI as baseline readings across sleep stages. However, the study lacked a control condition or comparisons with other signal designs, so the optimal alarm sound elements (e.g., frequency or volume) in this adult context remain to be determined.

섹션 3.3.: Music
----------------------------------------
Music interventions for counteracting sleep inertia (SI) are reviewed through two lines of inquiry. Hayashi et al. studied a 20-minute daytime nap at 14:00 h, where the Experimental group was awakened with either a high- or low-preference 60 dB stimulus, with high preference described as ‘popular music’ by participants and low preference as an ‘excitative’ piece (Mars from The Planets by Holst). The Control group was awakened by an intercom. After awakening, the Experimental group completed a visual oddball task (the Control group performed a memory search task) and both groups reported subjective sleepiness and comfort. The high-preference condition yielded better RT performance than the low-preference condition, although correct-response counts did not differ. Subjective sleepiness post-nap was reduced in the high-preference condition versus the intercom and low-preference, while low-preference did not differ from Control. Subjective comfort was highest in the high-preference condition compared with Control or low-preference. Taken together, these results imply that preferred music may attenuate SI in terms of RT and subjective sleepiness, although the lack of detailed musical characteristics and absence of analyses comparing music to intercom limit interpretability.

McFarlane et al. (two studies, 2020) extended this work ecologically with day-to-day awakening sounds tested remotely. In Study 83, an online questionnaire sought bottom-up insights into which sounds or music might mitigate SI and the attributes that contribute, finding no significant link between SI and waking-sound type or liking, though a melodic sound related to reduced SI on an adapted Sleep Inertia Questionnaire, whereas a neutral sound related to increased SI; melodic sounds also tended to be rated more rhythmic. Study 84 then used custom melodic and rhythmic stimuli in habitual environments (all stimuli shared at 105 BPM, 4/4, in the key of C with woodblock and vibraphone timbres). In two sessions, participants first faced a Control, then—depending on the group—a Melodic or Rhythmic treatment. The melodic treatment significantly reduced attentional lapses and false starts and yielded a higher PVT score than Control, though RT and response speed did not differ. The Rhythmic treatment showed no significant effects. These findings support melodic content as a potential driver in counteracting SI in ecological settings, while rhythmic stimuli alone did not produce improvements.

섹션 4.: Discussion
----------------------------------------
The authors used PRISMA systematic-review guidelines to identify peer-reviewed, English-language research assessing how auditory stimulation may influence sleep inertia (SI) upon and after awakening. This process identified twelve studies that met the criteria (Figure 1), and thorough examination of these studies yielded information on the range of auditory stimuli investigated and their potential efficacy. The ensuing summary aims to highlight gaps and outline directions for future research to strengthen the evidence base on how different auditory treatments may influence SI.

섹션 4.1.: Summary of Evidence
----------------------------------------
This section synthesizes findings from twelve studies retrieved from ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus and via Google Scholar, screened as shown in Figure 1, and grouped into three stimulus themes—Noise (58), Emergency alarms; Tone sequences, voice and hybrids (77–82), and Music (57, 83, 84) (Table 1)—across emergency (58, 77–86) and non-emergency awakenings (57, 83, 84) in laboratory and field settings. Sample sizes ranged from n = 14 to n = 188. Emergency-awakening research predominantly involved children, whereas non-emergency studies involved adults. In children, evidence favors a low-frequency T-3 signal (500 Hz square wave) and voice notifications over high-pitched alarms for awakening and post-awakening performance; a low-frequency alarm is more effective than a maternal alarm and than an actor’s voice in post-awakening performance, though there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about sleep inertia (SI) per se, making the T-3/voice design appear superior to higher-frequency (~2000–4000 Hz) pulsed or sequenced alarms. In adults, initial findings are limited: a high-frequency pulse alarm (2000–4000 Hz at ~60 dB) can awaken and reduce SI regardless of sleep stage, but lacks control or comparator conditions akin to the child studies, so the best option remains unresolved. Pink noise (5000 Hz, 75 dB) may enhance performance after early-night awakenings but not later ones, with insufficient evidence to generalize to children or adults. Across groups, no significant demographic differences in post-awakening RT to high-frequency alarms are detected, though data are limited and underpowered. Music appears beneficial for non-emergency awakenings in adults, with greater SI reductions when the waking cue is perceived as melodic or preferred by the listener; melodies and popular music enhance RT and sustained attention, whereas neutral and rhythmic stimuli are less effective.

섹션 4.2.: Limitations and Recommendations
----------------------------------------
This section identifies key limitations that constrain the ability to draw robust conclusions about auditory countermeasures for sleep inertia (SI) in both emergency and non-emergency awakenings across age groups, and offers directions for future work. The review highlights a shortage of focused research on SI post-awakening to audio, and substantial heterogeneity across studies in context, design, sample size, stimulus type, and SI assessment methods (both objective and subjective). A contextual bias in stimuli emerges, with music largely unexamined in emergency settings and alarm/voice treatments rarely evaluated in non-emergency settings. The authors advocate future research employing counterbalanced designs of alarm types across contexts to probe contrasting effects, and underscore the need for greater attention to demographics, particularly adults in emergency awakenings. Methodologically, laboratory studies typically use sound designs that are prudent but vary widely, limiting cross-study inference, while laboratory conditions often fail to replicate real-world waking, whereas field studies better reflect real sleep–wake behavior but face technical constraints in monitoring sleep stage at awakening, sometimes sacrificing EEG for ecological validity. Advances in remote data collection could reconcile laboratory rigor with field relevance. SI assessment would benefit from refined methodologies, including repeated testing across the post-awakening period and validated objective (e.g., PVT) and subjective (KSS, SIQ) metrics. Future work should incorporate controls (no-noise, standardized stimuli) and report signal specifications (rhythm, timing, pitch) to enable replication and meaningful comparison between voice and music approaches, with detailed reporting of music stimuli (e.g., genre). Open-access data reporting and comprehensive stimulus descriptions will improve reproducibility, while attention to potential biases in search terms and study inclusion remains prudent.

섹션 5.: Conclusions
----------------------------------------
From 1992 to 2020, this review synthesizes English-language empirical work on auditory countermeasures for sleep inertia (SI) after awakening, distinguishing emergency and non-emergency contexts. For children in emergency awakenings, low-pitch alarms or voice notifications outperform high-frequency alarms, especially for memory and reaction time, though definitive differentiation between low-frequency and voice alarms remains unsettled. For adults, evidence is insufficient to support firm conclusions about alarm types or voice signals for SI. In non-emergency awakenings, adults show positive responses to musical treatments, notably preferred popular music and melodic alarms. Overall, findings indicate the potential of sound and music to counteract SI, with opportunities to expand adult emergency studies using varied stimuli, compare treatments across demographics, and further examine musical interventions across children, adults, and emergencies. Refining field-study methods could yield ecologically valid insights and advance understanding of the neurophysiology and mechanisms by which sound reduces SI. Acknowledging possible adverse SI effects, these results should inform researchers and professionals in auditory perception, sleep and cognitive psychology, and sound design, and be relevant to industry in first response, transport, and high-risk settings.
