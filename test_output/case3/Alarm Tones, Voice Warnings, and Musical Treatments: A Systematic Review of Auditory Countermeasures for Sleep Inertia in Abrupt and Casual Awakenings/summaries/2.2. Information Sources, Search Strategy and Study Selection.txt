The information sources and study selection process relied on three electronic databases—ProQuest, PubMed, and Scopus—searched on 15 March 2020 for the term "Sleep Inertia" combined with alarm-related terms (including "Sound," "Noise," "Music," "Alarm," "Alarm Tone," "Alarm Sound," "Alarm Noise," "Alarm Music," "Alarm Clock," "Fire Alarm," and "Smoke Alarm"), yielding 341 records. After removing 140 duplicates, 201 records remained for screening, of which 187 were excluded based on title, abstract, and methodological criteria. Fourteen articles underwent full-text assessment, and 9 were excluded for not meeting inclusion criteria; one article was excluded due to unrelated procedures that could confound results, with authors noting the insignificant findings. This left five articles for which reference lists were screened, identifying one additional study for inclusion. To ensure no relevant literature was missed, the lead authors’ publication records for the six included articles were also examined via Google Scholar on 21 May 2020, chosen for its comprehensiveness despite potential imprecision. After removing duplicates from this secondary search, six more articles meeting the criteria were found, bringing the total number of articles for review to twelve. See Figure 1 for the screening flow diagram.
