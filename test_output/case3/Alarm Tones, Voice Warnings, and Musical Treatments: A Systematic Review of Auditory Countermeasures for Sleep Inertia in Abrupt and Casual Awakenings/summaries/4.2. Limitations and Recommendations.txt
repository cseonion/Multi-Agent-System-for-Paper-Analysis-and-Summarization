This section identifies key limitations that constrain the ability to draw robust conclusions about auditory countermeasures for sleep inertia (SI) in both emergency and non-emergency awakenings across age groups, and offers directions for future work. The review highlights a shortage of focused research on SI post-awakening to audio, and substantial heterogeneity across studies in context, design, sample size, stimulus type, and SI assessment methods (both objective and subjective). A contextual bias in stimuli emerges, with music largely unexamined in emergency settings and alarm/voice treatments rarely evaluated in non-emergency settings. The authors advocate future research employing counterbalanced designs of alarm types across contexts to probe contrasting effects, and underscore the need for greater attention to demographics, particularly adults in emergency awakenings. Methodologically, laboratory studies typically use sound designs that are prudent but vary widely, limiting cross-study inference, while laboratory conditions often fail to replicate real-world waking, whereas field studies better reflect real sleepâ€“wake behavior but face technical constraints in monitoring sleep stage at awakening, sometimes sacrificing EEG for ecological validity. Advances in remote data collection could reconcile laboratory rigor with field relevance. SI assessment would benefit from refined methodologies, including repeated testing across the post-awakening period and validated objective (e.g., PVT) and subjective (KSS, SIQ) metrics. Future work should incorporate controls (no-noise, standardized stimuli) and report signal specifications (rhythm, timing, pitch) to enable replication and meaningful comparison between voice and music approaches, with detailed reporting of music stimuli (e.g., genre). Open-access data reporting and comprehensive stimulus descriptions will improve reproducibility, while attention to potential biases in search terms and study inclusion remains prudent.
