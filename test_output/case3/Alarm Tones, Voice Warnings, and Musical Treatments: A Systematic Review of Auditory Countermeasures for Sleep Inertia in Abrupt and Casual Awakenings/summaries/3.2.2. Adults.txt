In this adult-focused study, Bruck and Horasan examined the awakening efficacy of a high-frequency pulse smoke alarm (2000–4000 Hz, ~60 dB) under naive and non-naive conditions. Participants were assigned to three sleep-stage groups (Stage 4, Stage 2, or REM), with the alarm sounding twice—first naive, then non-naive—triggered upon returning to the assigned sleep stage. After each awakening, they completed subjective sleep quality and sleep quantity measures and performed a computer-based reaction time task. The findings showed no significant differences in the time to reach full wakefulness between naive and non-naive awakenings across sleep stages, and no significant decline in RT performance post-awakening relative to pre-sleep and post-mower/shower control measures. Regarding sleep inertia (SI), the high-frequency pulse alarm was as effective at awakening and in reducing SI as baseline readings across sleep stages. However, the study lacked a control condition or comparisons with other signal designs, so the optimal alarm sound elements (e.g., frequency or volume) in this adult context remain to be determined.
