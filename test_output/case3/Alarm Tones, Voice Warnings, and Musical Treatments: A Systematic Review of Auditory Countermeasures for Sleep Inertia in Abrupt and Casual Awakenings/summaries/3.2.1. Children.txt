The opening child-focused study by Bruck (1999) examined 6–17 year-olds (mean 11.6) and included 36 subjects (22 children) tested in a four-night residential protocol with 60 dB alarms applied between 01:00 and 04:30 h; awakenings were assessed alongside parental controls. Findings showed that 85% of children slept through one or both alarms, while 100% of adults awakened to both; about 95% of all participants woke within 32 seconds of alarm onset. Subjective sleepiness and clarity (SI) did not differ between groups, with both ages reporting an average rating of moderately clear-headed and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) values indicating neither sleepy nor alert across test points. This work thus suggests a 60 dB alarm is less effective at waking children than adults, though successful awakenings were similar across groups with no significant SI differences.

Subsequent work by Bruck and Reid compared three field studies differing by alarm type: a mother’s voice plus an actor’s voice (Study 1, ~315 Hz–2500 Hz), a low-pitch temporal-T3 signal (500 Hz; Study 2), and a high-pitch Australian standard (~4000 Hz; Study 3), all around 89 dB, tested at about 01:00 h (and 03:00 h for some). Across studies, awakenings were significantly poorer with the Australian standard than with voice or low-pitch signals, and arousal sleep latency was longer for the standard. Ratings of clear-headedness showed no significant difference between alarm types, and mean KSS values hovered around 2–3 (sleepy but not deeply sleepy; neither sleepy nor alert). Overall, high-pitched signals were less effective for arousal than mixed low-frequency sequences, though all stimuli yielded some reduction in SI, with only moderate effects on sleepiness.

Building on this, Smith, Splaingard, and colleagues conducted a series of lab-based experiments using 100 dB parent-voice alarms against high-pitched T-3 tones (~3200–4000 Hz) to prompt awakening and self-rescue. In the first study, the parent voice outperformed the high-pitch alarm in awakening and in completing the escape within 5 minutes and within 3 minutes post-awakening. The second study added a hybrid alarm (T-3 plus pillow vibration); RTs were slower than baseline for all conditions, but the hybrid produced faster RTs than either parent voice or tone alone, with no difference between parent voice and tone. In later work, three Smith et al. studies repeatedly tested maternal-voice signals against T-3 tones at 85 dB, revealing that a high-pitch T-3 alarm was consistently less effective for awakening and self-rescue than the broader range of alarms tested. Within studies, there were no significant differences among the maternal voice variants (Name only, Instructions only, or Name plus Instructions) or between male vs female voices or a hybrid variant; however, a low-frequency T-3 signal (500 Hz) improved awakening time versus maternal voice and, compared with an actor’s voice, improved awakening time though not escaping. Across these studies, no significant dissociations emerged between awakening and escaping for the mother or stranger voice treatments.

Overall, across the child-focused work, SI symptoms are heightened when awakening to high-frequency alarms relative to voice or low-frequency alarms, with maternal or actor voices and low-frequency alarms showing comparable effectiveness in mitigating SI. Yet the literature requires larger, adequately powered trials to definitively parse interaction effects among the multiple alarm parameters.
