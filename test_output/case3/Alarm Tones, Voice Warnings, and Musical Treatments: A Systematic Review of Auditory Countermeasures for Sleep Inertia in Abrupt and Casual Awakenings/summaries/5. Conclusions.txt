From 1992 to 2020, this review synthesizes English-language empirical work on auditory countermeasures for sleep inertia (SI) after awakening, distinguishing emergency and non-emergency contexts. For children in emergency awakenings, low-pitch alarms or voice notifications outperform high-frequency alarms, especially for memory and reaction time, though definitive differentiation between low-frequency and voice alarms remains unsettled. For adults, evidence is insufficient to support firm conclusions about alarm types or voice signals for SI. In non-emergency awakenings, adults show positive responses to musical treatments, notably preferred popular music and melodic alarms. Overall, findings indicate the potential of sound and music to counteract SI, with opportunities to expand adult emergency studies using varied stimuli, compare treatments across demographics, and further examine musical interventions across children, adults, and emergencies. Refining field-study methods could yield ecologically valid insights and advance understanding of the neurophysiology and mechanisms by which sound reduces SI. Acknowledging possible adverse SI effects, these results should inform researchers and professionals in auditory perception, sleep and cognitive psychology, and sound design, and be relevant to industry in first response, transport, and high-risk settings.
