Section 3 reports that twelve studies met the inclusion criteria for this qualitative synthesis. The included research was conducted in the United States (n=5), Australia (n=5), France (n=1), and Japan (n=1), with publication dates ranging from 1992 to 2020, and five articles published in 2019â€“2020, indicating growing interest. Most ineligible studies did not directly analyze sound effects on symptoms of SI after awakening, were qualitative, or were not original research. Test stimuli varied: eight studies examined sound in an emergency awakening context using domestic fire alarms, human voice, or hybrids; three studied music; and one tested noise. Alternate stimuli included an intercom (n=1), multimodal conditions combining sound and vibration (n=1), and voice plus alarm (n=1). Ten studies reported stimulus loudness in decibels, with readings roughly between 60 dB and 100 dB. The objective and subjective measures used differed markedly, with all but one study employing objective measures and six not recording subjective measurements. For synthesis, three primary themes were identified: Noise; Emergency tone sequences and Voice alarms and hybrids; and Music.
