Retrieving prompts from large-scale datasets can be computationally intensive, especially when multiple exemplars are sought. To address this, the section adopts de-duplication to remove duplicate or near-duplicate items from the sample pool. It uses MinHash to identify demonstrative exemplars within the training data, representing each document xi (and xj) by sets of its n-grams di (and dj). The similarity between documents is measured with the Jaccard Index to quantify overlap between these n-gram sets, and highly matched documents with a Jaccard similarity greater than 0.8 are discarded.
