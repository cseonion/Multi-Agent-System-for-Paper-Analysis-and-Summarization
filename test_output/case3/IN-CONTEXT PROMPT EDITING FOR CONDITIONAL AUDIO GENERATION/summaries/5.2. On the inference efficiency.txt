Although in-context retrieval improves audio quality, inference-time efficiency remains a concern. On an Intel Xeon CPU with FAISS, the average search time for K = 100 candidates is 2. samples. Several factors influence speed: the number of clusters, where more clusters can improve performance but the gains are modest since LLM editing is also crucial; the number of retrieved candidates, since the similarity to the user query must be recomputed for each candidate, causing linear scaling of the pool size with speed; and the embedding dimension, fixed at 384 due to S-BERT.
