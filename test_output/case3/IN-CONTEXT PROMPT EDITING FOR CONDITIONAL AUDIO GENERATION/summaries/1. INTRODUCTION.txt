I didn’t receive any text yet. Please paste the raw text of Section 1 (and, if you have it, the summary of the previous sections) so I can produce a concise, paragraph-form summary that preserves all numerical details. I will summarize section by section, no bullet points, maintaining all key numbers and quantitative characteristics. If you have multiple sections, you can send Section 1 first and I’ll respond with its summary, then you can provide Section 2 with the prior section’s summary for continuity.
