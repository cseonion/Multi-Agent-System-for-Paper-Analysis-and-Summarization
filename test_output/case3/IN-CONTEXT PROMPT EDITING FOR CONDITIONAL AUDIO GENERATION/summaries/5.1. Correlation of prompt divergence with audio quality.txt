This section examines how exemplars influence audio quality through prompt divergence, using Table 1 and Figure 3. It finds that the average KL reduction scales linearly with quality, as measured by the normalized FAD reduction N(âˆ†FAD), indicating that retrieved prompts serve effectively as exemplars for LLM prompt editing. Additionally, the comparison of in-domain versus out-domain prompts shows that in-domain prompts as demonstrative exemplars yield higher audio quality, with domain relevance enhancing editing performance. Table 1 reports a +0.37 improvement in FAD and corresponding increases in both human evaluation metrics.
