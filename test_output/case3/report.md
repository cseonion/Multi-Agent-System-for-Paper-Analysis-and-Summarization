Here’s a concise, actionable blueprint that integrates the five works into a unified, human-centered generative audio program for creation, alarms, and evaluation.

Project goal
- Build a personalized, prompt-aware, evaluation-grounded text-to-audio system that:
  1) helps novices generate musically coherent audio,
  2) produces safer, more effective alarms for waking (sleep inertia mitigation),
  3) supports memory/emotion use-cases,
  4) is benchmarked with perception-aligned metrics.

Core hypotheses
- H1: Retrieval-augmented, in-context prompt editing reduces prompt–model distribution shift, improving audio quality and textual alignment versus user prompts alone.
- H2: Interface scaffolds (iterative prompt generation, side-by-side audio prior exploration) lower cognitive load and improve creative outcomes for novices.
- H3: For waking, melodic, user-preferred music reduces sleep inertia in adults; low-frequency tones and voice content are superior for children in emergency contexts.
- H4: Personal autobiographical salience enhances memory/emotion outcomes without harming musical quality when prompts are alignment-guided.
- H5: Automatic metrics trained on expert labels (MusicEval-like) correlate with human judgments sufficiently to guide rapid iteration.

System design (IteraTTA+In-Context Editing + Personalization)
- Frontend (creativity + control)
  - Theme-to-prompts via LLM with multiple musically rich candidates.
  - Grid-based A/B/C comparison of generated clips; quick edit/re-generate loop.
  - Audio priors: allow uploading or selecting prior clips to condition timbre/texture.
  - Prompt Alignment Meter: visualize estimated alignment (proxy: KL divergence to training prompt distribution) and offer “nudges” (style tags, structure hints).
- Prompt editing pipeline
  - Retrieve k nearest training prompts (SBERT/CLAP embeddings + Faiss; MinHash de-dup).
  - Compose an instruction + k exemplars + user query; LLM edits to in-distribution form.
  - Encoder-agnostic: support CLAP/RoBERTa/T5 text encoders for the audio model.
- Personalization layers
  - Sleep inertia (adults, habitual wake): emphasize melody, mid-tempo (≈80–110 BPM), warm timbre, moderate loudness ramp-up, user-preferred genre.
  - Children (emergency): low-frequency dominant alarms (~500 Hz T-3 pattern) and/or caregiver/actor voice warning; ensure intelligibility and distinctiveness.
  - Memory/emotion: ingest user-curated “meaningful music” list; semantically extract features (valence, era, instrumentation) to seed prompts and audio priors.
- Safety/UX details
  - Loudness control with gradual fade-in; ceiling levels by context.
  - Night mode profiles; one-tap switch between “gentle wake,” “urgent alert,” and “memory session.”
  - On-device privacy by default (local embeddings; opt-in cloud generation).

Content and prompt templates (starting points)
- Adult gentle alarm: “Soft, melodic wake-up cue with warm piano and soft pads, 90 BPM, major mode, low-mid spectral focus, gradual 30 s fade-in, soothing yet clear, no harsh transients.”
- Child emergency alert: “Low-frequency T-3 pattern centered near 500 Hz with clear female voice: ‘[Name], wake up now. Go outside.’ Slow sweep, high intelligibility, 60–70 dB at pillow.”
- Memory/emotion session: “Nostalgic 1990s pop ballad vibe, gentle strings and clean guitar arpeggios, moderate tempo 85 BPM, warm analog feel, evokes fond memories and calm.”

Evaluation plan
- Automatic (build on MusicEval)
  - Train CLAP+MLP predictors for two dimensions: musical impression and text alignment; extend with a third dimension for “alarm suitability” (melodicity, spectral centroid, onset sharpness, loudness envelope).
  - Report FAD, CLAP similarity, and prompt KL reduction; target measurable improvements (e.g., ≥0.1 FAD decrease, ≥0.05 SRCC uptick vs. baseline prompts).
- Human studies
  - Sleep inertia: within-subject, morning field study using PVT, KSS, SIQ; compare baseline beep vs melodic-personalized alarm; stratify by chronotype.
  - Children emergency simulations: awakening latency, compliance, and post-awakening task performance; compare high vs low frequency, voice vs tone, and hybrid.
  - Creativity/usability: time-to-satisfactory-output, NASA-TLX, SUS; qualitative prompt strategies learned.
  - Memory/emotion: autobiographical recall frequency, vividness ratings, mood scales; compare personalized vs non-personalized generative pieces.
- System-level benchmarking
  - Extend MusicEval prompts with alarm-specific and memory-evoking prompts; include expert raters for alarm suitability and semantic alignment.

Data and infrastructure
- Curate an alarm/music corpus with annotated acoustics (melodicity, fundamental frequency region, tempo, spectral centroid), text prompts, and contexts (emergency vs casual).
- Ensure diversity beyond pop/classical (R&B, EDM, regional genres) to mitigate cultural/style bias.
- Use Faiss for scalable retrieval; MinHash/Jaccard for de-dup; cache edited prompts to cut latency.

Success criteria (initial)
- Creativity: ≥15% reduction in iterations-to-keep vs baseline UI; SUS ≥80.
- Audio quality/alignment: system-level SRCC with expert scores ≥0.8 (musical impression), ≥0.7 (alignment).
- Sleep inertia: ≥10% improvement in PVT median RT and lapses vs baseline beep; significant KSS/SIQ improvements.
- Children emergency: reduced time-to-awaken and higher compliance vs high-frequency alarms.

Risks and mitigations
- Distribution shift in niche genres: add few-shot exemplars, dynamic retrieval pools, and user-visible alignment feedback.
- Overfitting to CLAP: include multi-encoder ensembles; regularly re-validate with blinded human ratings.
- Latency/compute overhead: cache retrieval results; progressive generation (draft/hi-fi); optional on-device inference.
- Personal data sensitivity: strict local processing; transparent consent; easy delete/export.

Research questions to pursue
- Does autobiographical salience boost SI mitigation or only memory/emotion outcomes?
- How much in-context exemplar count is optimal for prompt quality vs latency and user trust?
- Can a live “alignment nudge” interface measurably improve novice outcomes and reduce trial-and-error?

Roadmap
- Phase 1 (6–8 weeks): Retrieval+LLM prompt editor, IteraTTA-style UI, baseline CLAP evaluator; small N pilot for usability.
- Phase 2 (8–12 weeks): Sleep inertia field study (adults), alarm-suitability predictor, child emergency lab sim with voice/low-frequency conditions.
- Phase 3 (12+ weeks): Memory/emotion module with autobiographical personalization, extended MusicEval benchmark release including alarm prompts and new expert ratings.

This plan ties interface design (IteraTTA), in-context prompt editing, cognitive/perceptual insights (music–memory and sleep inertia), and perception-aligned evaluation (MusicEval) into a coherent, deployable system and research program.
