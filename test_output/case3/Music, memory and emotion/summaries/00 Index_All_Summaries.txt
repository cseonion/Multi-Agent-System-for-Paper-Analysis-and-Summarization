Please provide the raw text of the first section. If you have a summary of any previous sections, include that as well (though it’s not needed for the first section). I will produce a concise paragraph summarizing the section, preserving all key points and numerical details, in the required plain text format (no bullet points).

Recent work indicates that listening to music from one’s past can evoke autobiographical memories and strong positive emotions; in a study using large sets of short excerpts (each no longer than 30 seconds), about 30% elicited autobiographical memories and many also induced positive emotions such as nostalgia, consistent with broader findings that positive valence and arousal enhance memory. In a two-session design, Eschrich and colleagues had participants encode 40 musical pieces (each 20–30 seconds) and, a week later, recognize 40 old and 40 new excerpts; highly positive pieces were remembered better, while arousal did not predict recognition, suggesting valence rather than arousal drives musical memory, and a subsequent encoding task showed that forcing participants to attend to valence versus length/loudness yielded no difference in recognition, implying automatic emotional processing of music. The same lines of evidence come from Särkämö et al., who found that daily listening to favorite music after stroke significantly improved verbal memory and focused attention and yielded mood benefits (less depression and confusion) compared with listening to audiobooks or no material. Together these studies underscore music’s powerful influence on emotion and cognition and its potential therapeutic value. The section also discusses the neural basis and memory-system interactions involved in music: auditory working memory for sequences overlaps with verbal working memory, with Sluming et al. reporting greater gray matter in frontal regions in musicians, supporting some transfer to verbal tasks in tonal languages. There is evidence for distinct but interacting memory systems; Halpern and Müllensiefen showed that changes in timbre or tempo impaired explicit memory, and tempo changes impaired implicit memory, supporting dual memory systems for music, while Samson and Peretz linked right temporal regions to implicit melodic memory and left temporal regions to explicit melody retrieval. Pitch memory analyses reveal that nonmusicians can remember pitch to some extent, with Levitin reporting about 50% sang the correct pitch at least once and 44% were within two semitones; such pitch representations can be enhanced by training and by left supramarginal gyrus stimulation. In autobiographical memory and music, listeners often experience a strong “feeling of knowing,” and recall becomes more successful for titles when tunes are instrumental than melodies, whereas for vocal pieces the melody is a stronger cue; music may be encoded in perceptual rather than purely semantic memory, though associations with emotional and semantic information are possible. Stefan Koelsch and colleagues demonstrated bidirectional links between language and music memory: short musical primes can prime semantic language memory, reducing the N400 when semantically related to a target word, illustrating that musical fragments can facilitate language processing. Perceptual musical memory is relatively abstract and robust to changes in instrumentation or tempo, and neuroimaging shows a bilateral auditory-cortex basis with involvement of inferior frontal and temporal regions for recognizing familiar tunes. Distinct neural networks underlie episodic versus semantic musical memory: episodic musical memory engages bilateral middle and superior frontal gyri and precuneus (left bias), whereas semantic musical memory engages medial/orbitofrontal cortex, left angular gyrus, and left anterior middle temporal cortex, with partial overlap with verbal memory networks, indicating both shared and specialized neural substrates for music-related memory.
