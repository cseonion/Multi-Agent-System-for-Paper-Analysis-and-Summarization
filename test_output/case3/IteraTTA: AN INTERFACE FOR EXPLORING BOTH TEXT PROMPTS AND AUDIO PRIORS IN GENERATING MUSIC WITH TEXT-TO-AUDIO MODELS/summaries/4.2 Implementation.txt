We implemented IteraTTA as a web-based system aimed at novice users. On the backend, we used Python with FastAPI and GPT-3.5 to construct the initial prompts, and Audi-oLDM to generate the music audios. The audio length was fixed at 10 seconds to enable the GPU server (an NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti) to generate 12 audios (3 audios Ã— 4 prompts) concurrently, with an average generation time of about 15 seconds. Additionally, the DeepL API translates non-English prompts into English, which yielded better results in Section 3. The frontend is built with Vue.js, allowing users to download generated music audios or share them on Twitter.
