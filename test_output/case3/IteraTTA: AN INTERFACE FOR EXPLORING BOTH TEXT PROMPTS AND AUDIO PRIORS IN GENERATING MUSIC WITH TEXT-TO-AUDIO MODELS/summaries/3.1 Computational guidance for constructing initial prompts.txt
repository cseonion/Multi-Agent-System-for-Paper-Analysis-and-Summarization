Section 3.1 reports that volunteers struggled to craft effective initial prompts to activate the model. For example, the prompt “a song sounds like star wars” produced a battle-cry with a space-like sound, highlighting that the model’s music labels are largely musical descriptions—genres, instruments, and moods—and that prompts must align with those labels (e.g., “An orchestra plays a happy melody while the strings and wind instruments are being played”). The difficulty stems from a vocabulary gap between experts and novices and novices’ loosely specified goals, who typically refine objectives through iterative exploration. However, text-to-audio models depend on precise, clearly defined goals to initiate exploration, making initial prompt construction hard for novices. Consequently, providing computational guidance to help users build initial prompts could facilitate novice creativity, as exemplified by the successful prompting of “solemn music starting with a trumpet fanfare.”
