Section 5.3 analyzes 33 feedback responses, with the majority expressing positive experiences with the text-to-audio music creation process; examples include “It was a very interesting trial. I can interact with it throughout the day” and views of it as a source of sampling material and idea generator, with no negative feelings toward composing from text. The comments also suggest that IteraTTA’s novice-friendly features can benefit experienced users, echoing design requirements from Section 3 for open-ended exploration starting from loosely-specified theme phrases, such as “It was fun to encounter songs that fit the theme I provided but I had never heard before,” and “I really enjoyed … ChatGPT’s ability to associate and verbalize even seemingly unconnected ideas, which allowed me to provide crazy theme phrases.” Some users reported successful prompts after exploration, including adding a phrase of “simple progression” or limiting the number of tracks to yield stabilized music audios, for example: “Ideal harmonious song: balanced instrumentation, band sound, simple chord progressions, rhythmic drum patterns, catchy pop melody, up to 12 tracks,” and “Adding ‘clear sound quality’ produces less noisy audios.” It is notable that users gained knowledge about text-to-audio model behavior through iterative exploration, even without explicit description, and the authors note that prompt modifiers (quality boosters) known for text-to-image models would be among the first examples for text-to-audio models. They attribute this to user creativity in text-to-audio music generation and suggest it would be hard to derive without IteraTTA.
