IteraTTA is an interface designed to help novice users engage in text-to-audio music generation. Its design rests on two guiding principles: providing computational guidance to construct initial prompts and enabling dual-sided iterative exploration of text prompts and audio priors. The former assists users in translating loosely specified goals into starting prompts even when they lack rich artistic vocabularies, while the latter helps users grasp the space of possible results and progressively refine their aims. The authors deployed IteraTTA as a publicly available web service and analyzed user behaviors to demonstrate how these design choices support creativity. They emphasize that these principles generalize beyond the specific text-to-audio model to other models anticipated in the near future, arguing the work offers a foundation for enabling novice users to benefit from state-of-the-art models in the MIR community.
