We analyzed how users interacted with IteraTTA-generated results by inspecting the serviceâ€™s interaction logs and referring to Figure 5. The data show varied usage: some users tried the exploration feature only once, while others used it iteratively, alternating between entering text prompts and providing audio priors. In particular, one user repeated the refinement process 32 times, specifying text prompts 14 times and audio priors 18 times before sharing their final result on Twitter. These findings suggest that the dual-sided iterative exploration design helps users effectively leverage the text-to-audio model.
